A December economic analysis by BBVA Compass Bank foundthat indirect drought losses to the state’s agricultural industries could add another $3.5 billion to the toll. Impact were substantial on agriculture,  trees and plants, industry, power generation, water supply, and residents. Although this year was unusually wet, we do not know if next year, or the following year, will bring extreme flooding or drought.. or both.

However, the most significant flooding occurred along lower Onion Creek in southeast Austin. Flooding in the Onion Creek watershed exceeded the record stage and flow at the United States Geological Service (USGS) gauge located at U.S. Highway 183 South. The provisional data from the USGS indicated that this gauge peaked at 40.15 feet, which broke the previous record of 38.00 feet from the September 9, 1921, Storm. In Austin/Travis County, there were 745 homes that received some level of flood damage. Of these, 116 were completely destroyed, 441 received major damage, 122 had minor damage and 66 were reported as being affected - all in low-income communities. In Travis County, four people lost their lives due to this storm. Climate modeling indicates that these types of events are likely to happen more often and with potentially greater intensity.

Barcelona may experience a 1.6ºC increase in average annual temperature by the middle of the century and 1.7ºC by 2100, in the case of global emissions being reduced in accordance with the Paris agreements (committed scenario or RCP 4.5). This forecast could get worse if the current levels of emissions continue (passive scenario or RCP 8.5), producing a 2ºC temperature increase by the middle of the century and 3ºC by 2100. With regard to hot days (temperatures above 30ºC), Barcelona currently has an average of 22 days a year. Current models suggest an increase to 50 days a year by the end of the century for the committed scenario and 80 days a year for the passive scenario. In both scenarios, the areas most affected by high temperatures are those furthest from the sea, as its thermoregulatory effect does not reach them. Similarly, simulations carried out also suggest that in coming years heat waves may be more numerous, more severe and have a longer duration. Barcelona currently suffers an average of 1 heat wave every 4 years. In coming years, this number will increase, reaching 1 heat wave a year in the pledgedcommitted scenario and 4 or 5 heat waves a year in the passive scenario. Another major aspect is the foreseeable increase in the duration of these heat waves. An average increase of 3 days for the committed scenario and between 6 and 8.6 days for the passive scenario. In 2019 the city suffered  a heat wave that lasted 3 days. From 2015 to 2019 the city registered 4 heat wave event which represents 4 heat waves every 5 years.The results obtained by the RESCCUE project confirm the trends of climate change showed by the Climate Plan. The new climate projections developed within the project framework foresee that temperatures will increase progressively during the next years, been more heavily increased in summer. Also heat waves are expected to be more intense, lasting and long.

Regarding the former, most projections indicate that there may be an increase in rainfall intensity and a greater concentration of extreme episodes. Increased rainfall intensity may cause certain areas of the city to flood, as it will increase the flow of circulating water and test the city's drainage system to its limits. The second aspect is higher sea levels, which may condition the functioning of the drainage system in extreme situations. Under extreme conditions, an increase in sea level would mean that the overflow channels would not work properly, causing higher water levels in the network that could cause overflow at the surface, and therefore flooding in the street. The risk of flooding would affect some areas of the city more than others. For current situations, the conclusion is that for rainfall with a return period of 10 years (T10), The drainage system can function correctly (although it functions under pressure in some sections), but the two future scenarios under analysis both forecast flooding in some locations.The results obtained by the RESCCUE project shows that intensity of heavy rainfall events will increase from 20 to 40 % depending on the climate change scenario considered, RCP 4.5 or RCP 8.5 respectively.

A slight increase in demand is also forecast. This will aggravate the deficit in the supply that the city is already suffering today. Specifically, a reduction of 12% in surface resources and a reduction of 9% in underground resources are forecast by 2050. On the other hand, increased demand on the part of different city uses is estimated to be around 4%. There will there be an additional resource need for drinking water in general for the Barcelona Metropolitan Area of 34 hm3/year and for Barcelona city this is estimated at 18hm3/year.Eventhought 2018 has been one of the most rainy years of the historical series, we came forma a period of 4 extremely dry years which entailed the drought pre-alert by january 2018. Regarding 2019, no drought events have been suffered in Barcelona and Catalonia region.The results obtained by the RESCCUE project shows that the increase of evapotranspiration and the decrease of snowfall will reduce the watershed resources.

The future danger of fire shows us a situation similar to current danger, but with a slight overall increase in danger. The change in danger with the addition of climate change means an overall worsening across the territory, but with no specific area standing out particularly in terms of increased risk of more fires.Currently fire risk affects 1,000km of the road network, with the risk considered high and 39% of the railway network is also affected by high risk to fires (both roads and railway lines). Forest fires pose the greatest risk to energy infrastructure This risk already exists today, although it is expected that the impact of climate change will slightly worsen the trend compared to the current situation. This impact is mainly felt on electricity lines located in Collserola Park, but the greatest risk is to infrastructure in the metropolitan area, with a lower incidence in Barcelona. Fire risk affects 96% of overhead electricity lines and 44 substations, all considered high risk.

In normal conditions, this pollution is spread due to the effect of the wind and exported outside the city confines. The problem occurs when in atmospherically stable conditions (intense and persistent anti-cyclonic conditions that can also cause heat inversions) the concentration of the pollutant increases and creates a regional accumulation as a result of the stagnation of air masses.  Climate change could lead to an increase in the annual concentration of atmospheric pollutants, projections show an increase in the annual concentration of the pollutants analysed. The increase would be greatest in PM10 particles, average in NO2 and minimal in O3. All in all, under the hypothesis that emissions would be maintained, since it has not been possible to quantify its evolution over time. There has, however, been a downward trend in recent years, a foreseeable technological improvement, and changes in patterns of consumption and energy model are anticipated, which may have a significant impact on emissions levels in the future.It is forecast that for NO2 the number of high concentration days  could see an overall increase of 22% by the end of the century in both considered scenarios, which would mean 7 more days a year on top of the 30-day annual average at present. The effect of the concentration increase will be greatest in the summer months.In terms of suspended particlesparticulate matter (PM10), it is predicted that by the end of the century the number of high concentration days could increase up to 41% for the “committed” scenario and 60% in the “passive” scenario . The current annual average is 40 days, and according to forecasts they would increase by 16-24 days a year. The increase would be year-round, but mainly in the spring and summer.The increase in O3 is predicted to be low. Projections show that up to the end of the century there will be a overall increase in high concentration  days from 12-13% respectively in the “committed” and “passive” scenarios. With regard to the annual average of 18 days, in the current situation this would mean between 2 and 3 days more a year by the end of the century.

Current models suggest an increase to 50 days a year by the end of the century for thecommitted scenario and 80 days a year for the passive scenario. In both scenarios, the areas most affected by high temperatures are those furthest from the sea, as its thermoregulatory effect does not reach them. For the extreme case of torrid days (temperatures above 35ºC), the current average is nearly 1 day every 2 years. Under the committed scenario, simulations indicate that these phenomena will increase by approximately 2 days a year, while under the passive scenario the predicted increase will be 8 days.In 2018 the city suffered 30,6 hot days, which means an increase of 40% more than the average. Regarding torrid days, the city suffered 2,2 days, which was the estimated increase for the committed scenario.

Overflows may be affected, but data on these overflows is not available to determine the specific extent to which they would be affected. It would also aggravate the impact on the drinking water network and, to a lesser extent, on the phreatic network. It could also lead to the entry of sea water, rendering the aquifer unusable (saline intrusion). Road and railway networks are particularly exposed to floods, particularly  river and urban flooding.

In order to combat these pests and infestations research into techniques for fighting them, whilst also reducing the use of pesticides, will need to be intensified.

This is determined by three factors: the rise in sea level that causes a permanent flood; the tide and pressure and wind changes that generate a potential flood; and finally the effect of waves, which cause extreme flooding. Waves are currently responsible for causing major problems along the Barcelona coastline during extreme storm conditions. Climate projections show that there will be a general rise in sea level as a result of melting polar ice caps and heat expansions, and this increase will bring changes depending on the region. In addition, extreme events are predicted to be more frequent, although their magnitude will not change much. In the case of Barcelona, which previously was associated with return periods of 50 years, periods of 35 years are forecast by 2050. Regarding the Barcelona coastline, althoughthere are still not many studies that analyse the specific effect of climate change on the coastal dynamics of the area, approximations have been carried out that show that there is likely to be a triple impact on the coast as a result of climate change: an increase in flooding, morphological changes to the beaches and greater exposure of port infrastructures.

Initially the impacts were worse because winter planning had not been prioritised in the UK due to lack of snow. Impacts included disruption to infrastructure systems and delivery of critical services. Impacts have been reduced because systems for severe winter planning and business continuity have improved due to these extreme events. Although the overall trend is for fewer events like these, extreme cold and heavy snow is still likely to happen due to natural variability.

Summer precipitation is projected to decrease under all emissions scenarios. UK climate projections suggest that the rate of summer precipitation in Bristol could decrease by 18-45% between now and 2050 and by 26-68% by 2080. The realisation of this change would significantly increase the risk of drought in Bristol. Bristol is more vulnerable to droughts which haven't occurred during the historic record, specifically where a long-duration drought occurs or if there is a very severe drought that begins in early winter (i.e. reservoirs haven't refilled). The impacts of drought are exacerbated by extended periods of hot temperatures. More frequently occurring hot and dry periods also provides less opportunity for post-drought recovery.

However, climate change is likely to increase the frequency and intensity of the hazard, making the city more vulnerable.  Winter precipitation is projected to increase, meaning milder and wetter winters in Bristol. Under RCP8.5 scenario winter precipitation could increase by up to 50% by 2080. This considerable increase of winter rainfall and a change in pattern of summer rainfall events exposes Bristol to fluvial (river) and pluvial (rainfall) flood risk of both greater extent and frequency of occurrence. Given the projected impacts of climate change on precipitation and sea level rise, flooding is considered to be the greatest physical hazard facing the city.

However, projected sea-level rise due to climate change is likely to increase the risk of tidal flooding in the city centre and coastal flooding in the Avonmouth region in the future. In an RCP8.5 scenario, the sea level around Bristol is projected to rise by over 70cm in the next 60 years. Sea level rise in the south of the UK is projected to be more severe than the rest of the UK due to land movement. Given the projected impacts of climate change on precipitation and sea level rise, flooding is considered to be the greatest physical hazard facing the city. The greater the duration of a flooding event, the greater the impact on the city. For example, where a flood event impacts transport infrastructure, access to facilities, such as healthcare, or the movement of supply chains would greatly be impeded. This has knock on effects on the population’s way of life, which would only increase in severity with duration.

In addition this loss in snow has negatively effected the Ski resort industry which is a large portion of Vermont's tourism sector.  In addition extreme hot days increase the amount of energy use primarily due to air conditioners used during the summer months.  Furthermore extreme hot days pose a health risk as heat stress becomes more prominent, especially in vulnerable populations such as children and senior citizens.

As the city has become more built up, the river walls have been raised incrementally. There are already many Londoners, businesses, and properties in flood risk areas. These areas tend to include a higher proportion of people on low incomes. For these households, a flood can often be even harder to cope with and recover from. This is because poorer people and small businesses may lack appropriate insurance cover or the funds to properly repair the premises. They may also lack a wider support network to help them cope with, and recover from, flooding. In many cases the physical and mental health impacts of being flooded can last for many years. It is not uncommon for flood victims to report being anxious every time it rains. Londoners' awareness about flooding varies widely. Flood risk management authorities must consider that the number of properties at low risk of flooding will increase as development happens in the floodplain, albeit in areas protected by the Thames tidal defences. The Thames Barrier is closing more frequently now than when it was first built, as sea level affect peak high tide and surge levels.

The UK experienced a heatwave in 2019 which led to 900 excess deaths nationwide. London experienced a further heatwave in August 2020 where temperatures exceeded 36C and six consecutive days exceeded 34 C. The August 2003 heatwave provided a dramatic example of how vulnerable London is to extreme heat. It is estimated that at least 600 people died in London because of the heatwave. The impact of the 2003 heatwave on Londoners appears to have been greater than anywhere else in the UK. An analysis of the excess deaths during the August 2003 heatwave for each UK government region shows that whilst London did not experience the highest temperatures nationally, London had the highest number of excess deaths for any region (600), even allowing for the size of its population. Further research suggests that the number of deaths in response to rising temperatures in London increases above 24.7 C (which is a higher threshold than in other UK regions) and that above this threshold, there is a greater increase in the number of deaths per degree Celsius rise in temperatures than in other regions with lower thresholds. The reasons for this vulnerability are that London is in the warmest part of the UK and therefore our thermally poor homes are more likely to overheat. Global average temperatures have risen by over 1°C since 1850. If the world continues emitting greenhouse gases at today’s levels, then average global temperatures could rise by up to 5°C by the end of this century. Average temperatures in London are already getting higher. Projected increases in average monthly temperatures in London until 2050 show a 5-6°C increase in summer and winter averages. This will have an impact on health, infrastructure, comfort, and the operation of the city. The urban heat island (UHI) effect means that the centre of London can be up to 10°C warmer than the rural areas around the city. The temperature difference is usually larger at night than during the day. Increased development and urbanisation intensify the UHI effect.

This is due to increasing areas of impermeable surfacing, such as roads, roofs, and pavements. London also has a Victorian drainage system that wasn't designed to cope with the demands of the current and future population. There are 68,499 residential properties and 12,148 commercial properties at high risk of surface water flooding in London. There are 164,546 residential properties and 25,623 commercial properties at medium surface water flood risk in London. Parts of London's combined sewer system are close to reaching capacity, increasing the risk of surface water and sewer flooding. In several locations, areas that currently experience capacity issues are earmarked for significant growth in homes and jobs, which, without mitigation, risks making the problem worse. London's sewerage system was designed for a smaller London of four million people. As London has grown, the frequency and magnitude of stormwater discharges has increased, from occasionally in the late 19th century to more than once a week today. Stormwater discharge results in dilute sewage being released into the river Thames. Insufficient capacity in London's combined drainage networks means London's wastewater treatment and collection system is considered inadequate to meet EU Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive (UWWTD) requirements. The Tideway Tunnel is under construction and Lee Tunnel has been built to reduce storm water overflows into the River Thames and meet the requirements of the UWWTD.

A phased approach starts with information provision, awareness raising, and voluntary measures to restrict water use. It then escalates to compulsory measures if resource pressures worsen. Drought measures reduce the amount of water that people use through, for example, temporary use bans, such as on washing cars. However, they also have environmental impacts, as the usual restrictions on the amount of water abstracted from rivers and groundwater may be temporarily relaxed. This can result in low flows in rivers and impacts on wetlands. It causes a related reduction in water quality, and damage to river and other water body ecosystems. In some places this can be dramatic, such as in the groundwater-fed chalk streams, a globally rare habitat.

Left unmitigated, the tidal flood risk to London will increase as sea levels rise. A 0.9 metre rise in mean tide levels is projected by 2100 over pre-industrial levels. Part of London (approximately 15 per cent) sits in the natural tidal floodplain. Many parts of the city nearest the river would flood on virtually every high tide, were it not for the Thames flood defences. The current flood risk to London is highest when a spring tide coincides with a North Sea tidal surge. This is caused by a specific set of meteorological conditions, including low pressure over the North Sea and a northerly wind resulting in raised sea levels.

This is especially true during the periods when the heat is high throughout the day. When the nights are warm, the body does not recover. The risk groups for heat waves are elderly, chronically ill, people with disabilities, young children and pregnant people and people who take certain medications that affect the body's ability to adapt body heat and fluid balance.People in cities where heat build-up is great risk to a greater extent being exposed to heat stress and heat-related health effects than people living outside the city. The risk of heat stress increases when working outdoors and other physical exertion in heat. The heat stress involves strain on the heart and blood circulation. When the sweating is unable to cool the body, the temperature in the body rises. Combined with fluid deficiency, stresses on the body increase.Studies from Umeå University, Occupational and Environmental Medicine, show that at a daily mean temperature of over 22–23 ° C for at least two days, mortality increases. Such an average temperature often means that during the day it is over 30 ° C hot and close to 20 ° C at night. SMHI has estimated that extremely hot occasions that have so far occurred every twenty years on average can occur every three to five years at the end of the century. Daytime temperatures of 40 ° C can be relevant every twenty years in southern Sweden.

In the long-term, Southern Nevada’s community, economy, and agricultural sector would be affected by the availability of water. The elevations in Lake Powell and Lake Mead are intended to rise and fall to capture excess water in high flow years and to buffer against dry years (or droughts). The Secretary of the Interior is responsible for delivering water from Lake Mead to the Lower Basin States and Mexico. Shortages and surpluses of water are based upon Lake Mead's elevation. If Lake Mead dips below 1,075 feet, the Secretary of the Interior could declare a shortage, meaning Nevada and the other Colorado River Basin states would be required to reduce its Colorado River allocation. The amount of allocation reduction depends upon Lake Mead’s elevation level. As of December 31, 2019 despite winter conditions in the Colorado Rockies and the Colorado River Basin, the projected elevation has remained above 1,075 feet.

Most regions in California will likely see a decrease in fall and spring precipitation. The majority of precipitation will continue to fall during the winter, though frequency and intensity will become more and more unpredictable. Additionally, periods of severe drought may be followed by extreme precipitation events leading to risk of flooding, mudslides, and damage to water infrastructure. In March 2017, Mayor Garcetti declared a state of emergency to address unprecedented snowmelt in the Owens Valley. After a historic, multiyear drought, the state experienced a wet winter season that led to record snowpack 241% above normal in the Eastern Sierras. In times of extreme precipitation and when there is more rain and less snowpack, the City and State need to manage greater amounts of water earlier in the year. Wet years like 2017 are a reminder that investments in local water supply are crucially important—particularly the expansion of spreading grounds, recycled water infrastructure, stormwater capture, and cleaning our groundwater basins. LADWP plans to invest $2.4 billion over the next 10 years in water system infrastructure improvements, including local water supply development projects. Resilient water infrastructure will ensure the City is prepared to handle both extreme wet and extreme dry years.

Notably, 2015 replaced 2014 as the hottest year on record in California. Climate scientists at UCLA project that this warming trend will continue and that the region will be at least 3° warmer between 2040 and 2060, even with reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. By 2100, Los Angeles’ average annual temperature may increase as much as 8° degrees under a business-as-usual emissions scenario. Angelenos will also face more extreme heat days, which are days with temperatures over 95°. All Los Angeles communities are projected to experience additional extreme heat days each year; however, some neighborhoods will experience at least twice as many as they do today. The city’s urban landscape is covered with paved surfaces that absorb heat. This heat then re-radiates and warms surrounding air, creating an urban heat island effect, which can add as much as 6–10° to the background temperature. The rising local temperatures and increase in the number of heat waves, as well as the increase in both the severity and the length associated with a single heat wave, also significantly impact public health. Hospital admissions spike on peak heat-wave days, with particular impacts for cardiovascular, respiratory, and heat-related illness.

Rising temperatures contributed to a reduced Sierra snowpack, which provides as much as 1/3 of California’s water supply. This loss in water supply resulted in Los Angeles importing up to 80% more water during the drought. The warming trend and reduced snowpack are projected to worsen in future droughts, but the severity of their impact will depend on our efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A recent study of the warming impacts on California’s snowpack during drought found the following:- In the “snow years” (November–June of 2011–2012 through 2014–2015), human caused warming reduced average Sierra Nevada snowpack levels by 25% compared with a climate model simulation without human caused warming.- Using the warming conditions expected in 2081–2100 under a business-as-usual scenario of greenhouse gas emissions, a model simulation of the recent drought saw average snowpack was reduced by 85% compared with what actually occurred in the winters of 2011–2012 through 2014–2015. Nearly all snow is lost at elevations below 8,000 feet.- Loss of snow in drought years will be made worse by climate change, no matter which greenhouse gas emissions pathway the world follows. Additionally, periods of severe drought may be followed by extreme precipitation events leading to risk of flooding, mudslides, and damage to water infrastructure. In March 2017, Mayor Garcetti declared a state of emergency to address unprecedented snowmelt in the Owens Valley. After a historic, multiyear drought, the state experienced a wet winter season that led to record snowpack 241% above normal in the Eastern Sierras.

These fires alone burned more than 30,000 acres of both urban andwildland, destroying or damaging nearly 250 structures, contributing to California’sworst fire season in recorded history. As Los Angeles’ Mediterranean climate – characterized by dry summers and seasonal winter rain – adjusts to a newnormal in the face of climate change, longer and hotter periods of drought followed by heavy rains will intensify the existing conditions for wildfires. These climatic factors are further exacerbated by Los Angeles’ hilly and peri-urban terrains, which, while often attractive for residential uses, are at risk of overcrowding as the population grows. As a consequence of these changing conditions, wildfires in Los Angeles are likely to become both more frequent and devastating. A prime example of this is the 2017 Thomas Fire and the devastating landslide, which occurred when an intense rain event shortly followed the fire. The Thomas Fire is the largest wildfire in recorded CalFire history and engulfed nearly 300,000 acres, over 1,000 structures, and claimed 22 lives (inclusive of mudslide fatalities) in neighboring Ventura and Santa Barbara Counties. This single fire event demonstrates thedangerous possibility of increased loss of life and irreversible damage to property,biodiversity, and air quality.

The flood was triggered by rainstorms that delivered 10 inches of rain from February 27-March 4. Overall, the flood of 1938 was responsible for approximately $70 million in damages including destroying 5,601 houses, damaging a further 1,500, killing upwards of 110 people, and stranding over 800 cars. The channelization of the LA River provided flood control for the increasingly developed region and a consistent path for the river course. The process began in 1938, and by 1960, the project was completed to form a fifty-one mile engineered waterway. The 51-mile Los Angeles River connects many of L.A.’s vibrant neighborhoods and serves as the main waterway for an 870-square-mile watershed. The river has enhanced the resilience of Los Angeles and the region by providing engineered drainage – able to endure storms and move rainwater swiftly from the land to the sea. However, the same system has caused unintentional yet severe negative effects to the region’s ecological and community resilience, stemming from habitat fragmentation, biodiversity loss, and diminished access to open space and natural resources for hundreds of thousands of people in river corridor neighborhoods.

This increase will impact coastal infrastructure, ports, and beaches, leading to flooding during high tides, increased coastal erosion, potential for landslides, and saltwater contamination of freshwater sources. In addition to physical vulnerabilities, many coastal communities also face socioeconomic challenges. For example, the low-lying communities around the Port of Los Angeles are vulnerable becauseof lower per capita income and linguistic isolation, while communities like Venice arevulnerable because of older housing stock and the high percentage of renters. These impacts will have consequences for both residents and the economy. As climate change increases the likelihood of coastal impacts like severe storms, higher sea levels will increase the severity of such events. Sea level rise will increase the population exposed to combined permanent and temporary inundation from coastalflooding. Currently, 0.1 percent of the population (3,406 persons) is estimated to reside in areas that are expectedto be inundated by the 25-cm sea level rise with storm scenario, and 0.24 percent (10,010 persons) reside in areasthat are expected to be inundated by the 150-cm sea level rise with storm scenario.

Under the Ecocities project (Cavan 2010), 3 climate zones were defined for GM.  The increases of heat stress (and max temp) is most prevalent for GM’s Mersey Basin zone, which is where the vast majority of Manchester is situated.This increases the risk of negative impacts linked to high temperatures, such as negative health effects and reductions in the productivity of employees. This is particularly important due to economic activity concentrated in the city region core (and the Mersey basin zone) and the prevalence of vulnerable groups (deprived, health impacted, young and elderly) in the spatial locations projected to suffer the worse increases as well as urban heat island effect as a forcing factor on top.Therefore, the spatial pattern of Manchester's urban heat island demonstrates that certain areas, generally those where development density is at its highest, are more likely to suffer from negative impacts as a result. There is also an equality dimension to heat stress. For example,  there is greater potential exposure to heat stress in more deprived areas. In effect, groups that are vulnerable to heat stress, due to factors including poverty and poor health, show the highest potential exposure to this climate change impact.

The physical processes that cause barrier island erosion and wetland loss throughout the Louisiana delta plain are complex and varied.  Coastal erosion along the Louisiana Gulf Coast is an ongoing process that continues to threaten the wetlands and barrier islands. The erosion process has been accelerated by strong storms and hurricanes, which can erode large sections of coastline with a single event. The creation of canals by the shipping and oil industries have also contributed to this erosion.

Orleans Parish is threatened by hurricanes that develop in the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico, and the entire Parish is susceptible to hurricanes and tropical storms.  Hurricanes generate several hazards that can cause extensive damage. High winds, heavy rainfall, tornadoes, and storm surge are all associated hazards. This subsection focuses on the effects from high winds associated with hurricanes. Storm surge is often the greatest hurricane-related threat to property and human life. In Orleans Parish, the area’s low elevations and network of levees make it especially vulnerable to the surge of a hurricane. The effects of a strong hurricane can be catastrophic to any location; however, New Orleans is especially vulnerable because of the threat to a system of levees that channel and hold the waters of canals, Lake Pontchartrain, and the Mississippi River. Past hurricanes and tropical storms have had a major, and in some cases devastating, impact on life and property in Orleans Parish.

There is no way to place a value on the loss of human life. Potential losses such as power outages could affect businesses, homes, and critical facilities. High demand and intense use of air conditioning can overload the electrical systems and cause damages to infrastructure. If an extreme heat event occurred within the planning area, the event could potentially cause a loss of electricity for ten percent of the population at a cost of $126 per person per day. At 2015 population levels, this would result in $4,498,351 of assumed damage per day.

The effects of storm surge can be felt in the Parish from hurricanes that make landfall as far away as Texas, Mississippi, or Alabama. The extent of the storm surge hazard covers the entire planning area, and is made worse in some areas based on such factors as elevation and proximity to flood sources (which are in turn related to potential levee failures). Based on historical events and future projections, storm surge up to 15 feet can be expected in some areas of the City. The storm surge threat in Orleans Parish has increased over the past 150 years due to a variety of factors such as coastal erosion, loss of wetlands, and sea level rise.

Louisiana has the largest number of repetitive loss properties of any State, and since the inception of the NFIP in 1968, has the largest numbers of claims and total amounts of claims nationally. Cloudbursts as well as rainfall associated with tropical events can produce significant about of water and the frequency and intensity of such weather events is increasing in the city.  Most of Orleans Parish is below sea level and has minimal elevation change.  As a result, when heavy rainfall occurs, water tends to pool rather than run off rapidly and must be pumped out, over the levee system into Lake Pontchartrain.  The city has a significant storm water system in place to evacuate the water, however, due to aging infrastructure and an increasing number of rainfall events exceeding the design capacity of the system, flooding from accumulated water poses a major risk multiple times a year.  System improvements along with more green infrastructure and non-energy-intensive storm water management is needed to address this hazard.

This series of events, in turn, resulted in several boil water advisories, comprising public health. In a nearby parish (county), utility power lines galloped causing widespread power outages to thousands of homes and businesses.  The older building stock in New Orleans is less adapted to addressing cold weather and requires hardening and insulation to protect against the adverse impacts of more frequent extreme temperature events. Additionally, updates to city infrastructure to protect against winter weather must also be considered.

Vector-borne disease outbreaks claim lives and cost local communities’ valuable resources. The West Nile virus outbreak of 2002 in Louisiana caused 24 premature deaths, 204 hospitalizations, 135 emergency room visits, and 5,800 outpatient visits. Mosquito populations thrive in warm climates. Frequent rains make for flower pots and wheelbarrows full of water, which are prime breeding grounds for mosquito eggs. The warmer weather will also lengthen mosquito season or the period when mosquitoes bite people and can transfer disease In addition to higher populations from warmer, wetter weather, increased flooding will displace rodents from their habitats and bring them into closer and more frequent contact with humans. Thus, rodent-borne diseases will also be more likely to be transmitted to humans.

The frequency and severity of rain events will likely increase due to changing weather patterns related to climate change. Most of New Orleans is surrounded by levees. Within the levees, elevation doesn’t change much, making the city like a shallow bowl. And, because of subsidence, many parts of the city are sinking even more. Impermeable surfaces like buildings, streets, and parking lots mean there's not a lot of green space where rain can absorb into the ground. Excess rainwater that cannot be absorbed must be pumped out.  When heavy rain outpaces the ground's ability to absorb water and the drainage system's capacity, minor and even major flooding can happen. These heavy rains can happen often. In fact, in the last 20 years, New Orleans has seen 42 flood events.  Coastal communities outside of the levee system in New Orleans are also at risk for flooding from waves during storms.

By the 2050s, mean summer temperature could be up to 3.7°C higher than the baseline (1981-2000) average, and mean winter temperature could be up to 2.9°C higher, based on the RCP8.5, 90% probability level. Mean daily maximum and minimum temperatures will also increase across Nottingham. The increase in mean daily maximum temperature in summer is projected to be up to 4.5°C; and up to 2.8°C increase in mean daily minimum winter temperature compared to 1981-2000 baseline (RCP8.5, 90% probability level). Nottingham faces threats associated with increasing mean temperatures, particularly in summer. This may negatively affect conditions in buildings and the built environment leading to heat related damage, and also disruption to the council’s transport network and energy supply. The ‘Urban Heat Island’ effect may also become more of an issue, which can cause increased demand for cooling. The comfort of vulnerable citizen groups is of a particular concern, along with the associated potential implications on demand for NHS services.

This is largely surrounding the sea front area where when storm surges occur, the drainage systems cannot pump out from their overflows into the Thames. There are also other spots such as Victoria Avenue (The main road into Southend) and nearby the airport where flooding is frequent compared to other areas. This is all due to outdated sewage systems and can sometime cause an overflow from the sewers which potentially puts public health at risk. Whilst Southend is a very dry area of England, the frequency of storm surges is becoming more frequent and the increasing dry weather in the area is reducing the efficiency of soil to absorb water.  In addition, the borough comprises a lot of grey infrastructure, which makes flood risk more likely because natural systems are unable to reduce the risk of flash floods and heavy rainfall. Heavy rainfall caused widespread flooding in June 2019 and highlighted the problems that the borough faces in the future.

The main area of sea front in Southend from the Golden Mile towards Westcliff-on-Sea has flooded several times in the last decade. There is an area in Westcliff near the sea front casino that is subject to sea wall breaches frequently. Although this does not affect many businesses, it is still affecting some and also impacts drivers as they have to navigate through flood waters breaching the road.

The area is affected more than once a year with heat waves in which people struggle to remain cool or find substantial areas of shading. The heat island effect is very much an issue in Southend - Something that is being addressed by the Interreg Cool Towns project. Unless we are able to deploy more greening in Southend then the area will continue to be subjected to severe heat. There is additional risk for human health due to the number of tourists and visitors who arrive in Southend to access the beaches on warm, hot days. Over the course of  the year Southend attracts 5.5 million visitors, with issues around heat stress likely to intensify in terms of more intense and longer heatwaves this could have a huge detrimental impact across the borough, particularly for vulnerable people, we have a high proportion of elderly people living in the borough. In addition, insulation programmes in households that target vulnerable (fuel poor) people could have the impact of making homes warmer during summer months.

Cities 2020	31009	City of Copenhagen	Denmark	Europe	Climate Hazards and Vulnerability	Climate Hazards	1		Extreme Precipitation > Rain storm		High	High		Commercial; Residential; Transport		Increasing	Increasing			In the summer of 2011, in 2014 and again in 2015, there have been torrential downpours in Copenhagen. The same picture will increasingly occur in years to come. If the projections of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) prove correct, there is a risk of the costs of damage in Copenhagen over the next 100 years totalling DKK 16 billion. This is a conservative estimate. Before the downpour in the summer of 2014, the cost of damage from extreme rainfall events already totalled DKK 6 – 9 billion over the past 6 years.   There is much to suggest that the costs of damage will be higher than DKK 16 billion based on an assessment of rainfall events in recent years.   (Source: ”Climate Change and Adaptation and Investment Statement” adopted by the City Council, City of Copenhagen, November 26, 2015, Danish version of the statement)

The climate adaptation plan therefore recommends that the urban climate is borne in mind when the city is developed and modernised, and that the city’s green structures are used to prevent “heat islands” and the formation of high surface temperatures in the city.

During winter of 2019, Coventry experienced higher than average rainfall rates, causing surface flooding. The surface water mostly impacted public transport and road traffic. It is likely the intensity and frequency of rainfall and consequently surface water flooding will increase in the future which could affect industry and the economy if it prevents the public getting to and from work safely.

With more people suffering ill-health as a result of poor housing quality, greater demand will be placed on the health services. If snow is more frequent then transport links will be affected as we currently don't cope very well which may have an impact on industry, if companies can't get goods in/out and education, if students/teachers can't get in/out.

Some of the most vulnerable communities in the city are also in flood prone areas. With severe rainfall events predicted to increase and intensify in future, flooding in the city and the subsequent disruption to all sectors will increase unless measures are taken to alleviate and adapt to these impacts. Increasing rainfall precipitation will lead to increasing dampness and water damage to buildings, and this is already being seen in city’s buildings, and affecting our buildings and monuments in Edinburgh’s World Heritage Site.

A major impact has been the cancellation of major events in the city. Edinburgh is a festival city, and the annual festivals bring great economic and cultural benefits to the city. Future impacts would mean re-examining how some major events are held, and at what time of year, as well as ensuring our property and infrastructure are future-proofed to cope with severe wind.

This with the added problem of increasing urban creep, has led to problems of both flooding – transport disruption, damage to infrastructure, localised flooding and flooding of domestic homes, increased pressure on emergency responders and a reduction in water quality due to pollutants being flushed off hard surfaces, and the capacity of the sewer network being exceeded. These events have incurred large financial clean up and repair costs on the Council and others. This is likely to become more of an issue in the future with more intense precipitation events expected. Scottish Water have completed a sewer integrated catchment study for most of Edinburgh, the results of this will be used to start preparing surface water management plans.

These schemes are designed for a 1 in 200-year event and include an allowance for climate change. Undeveloped areas of land fulfil an important flood function and should be allowed to flood to protect built-up areas from floodwater. These are shown on the Edinburgh Local Development Plan Proposals Map as areas of importance for flood management. There are also robust inspection regimes in place for watercourses, coastal defences and reservoirs. These inspections help inform and prioritise planned maintenance work.  In the event of flooding the Council provides an emergency response. The Council works in partnership with neighbouring local authorities, SEPA and Scottish Water and has prepared a Local Flood Risk Management Plan (LFRMP) for the Forth Estuary Catchment which will outline strategies and identify areas vulnerable to flooding from all sources and potential mitigation measures and actions. This plan was published in June 2016.

Much has historically been reclaimed from the sea. 74% of the city’s coast is classified as artificial (sea walls and harbour) and the natural coast line is made up of soft sediment, which is susceptible to coastal erosion. A significant number of buildings and infrastructure worth over £300 million have been built in locations that would be at risk to coastal erosion if the coastal defences were damaged or removed. Rising sea levels and storm surges have caused flooding and coastal erosion affecting coastal venues, travel and art works, and risks to redevelopment along Edinburgh’s coast.  These impacts are likely to increase as sea levels rise and there is increases in storm surges. A flood map published by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency shows some areas on Edinburgh’s waterfront potentially at medium to high risk of coastal flooding, taking into account climate change. Edinburgh’s Local Development Plan does not prevent development in such locations but will require all proposals to consider and address any potential risk of flooding through flood risk assessments and surface water management plans.

These have led to some buildings overheating and emergency services being called out to those suffering from heat related afflictions; increased number of people using parks/open spaces putting pressure on public and emergency services and resources. There has been some transport disruption due to high temperatures affecting road surfaces and train services. This is likely to increase in the future as Scotland’s buildings and infrastructure have not been built for increasing temperatures.

According to down-scaled climate change projections developed by DC, in the past, the average heatwave in DC lasted just under 5 days. In the future, the average length is expected to be around 6 days by the 2020s, 8 to 9.5 days by mid-century, and 9.5 days to 12 by the 2080s. Vulnerable populations including the elderly, homeless residents, low income residents and those with medical conditions are most at risk for heat stroke and other heat related health conditions, due to exposure and limited mobility. Heat waves will also impact energy infrastructure, as peak demand for cooling could strain the distribution system, and transportation as existing roads and rail lines were not designed for temperature extremes expected by the 2080s.

Local sea levels have risen an average of 3.2 mm per year over the last century due to a combination of global sea level rise and local subsidence. Sea level is projected to increase as much as (high scenario) 1.4 feet by 2050 and 3.4 feet by 2080 according to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The District is already experiencing an increase in tidal nuisance flooding due to sea level rise. Higher sea levels, coupled with more severe coastal storms, will cause more serious coastal flooding in the future. Coastal floods pose a serious risk to the District’s critical infrastructure systems including transportation and water systems, as well as significant cultural resources on the National Mall.

That number is projected to increase to 12 days by the 2050s and 13 days by the 2080s. The number of days per year with more than 2 inches of rainfall per 24-hour period is expected to increase, to an average of 3.5 days per year by the 2050s and between 3.5-4.5 days per year by the 2080s. Changes in rainfall volumes have a significant impact on drainage infrastructure and flooding (see also coastal, flash/surface flood). As precipitation patterns become more intense and frequent, the effectiveness of new construction projects designed to alleviate flooding and/or upgrades to existing stormwater and wastewater infrastructure to mitigate flooding will need to be evaluated.

Between 2003 to 2008, there were 31 heat-related deaths in Harris County. The National Center for Atmospheric Research estimates that by 2050 more than half of summer nights in Houston may qualify as high heat stress nights and the number of summer days that qualify for heat advisories may increase. Increased energy usage also means increased water usage for the energy production at power plants. Additionally, hot and sunny conditions paired with increased electricity usage can lead to greater ozone formation, and the greater Houston region is currently failing to meet its federal and state ozone standards.

Flooding can disrupt mobility, damage buildings and assets in the community assets, and increase risk of a water-borne illnesses. Flooding in the area also increases risk of environmental contamination. In the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, Escherichia coli was found in flood waters at 4 times the level considered safe. Additionally, elevated levels of lead and arsenic were found in flood water. Flooded houses also face risk of mold growth which can irritate or damage the respiratory tract and exacerbate chronic conditions such as asthma and some pulmonary conditions.

It is estimated that a “Hurricane Katrina-like” storm would cause aggregate losses to the Texas economy of $73 billion in gross product, $61.3 billion in income and 863,000 jobs. Hurricane Ike in 2008 cost the region $30 billion in damages and Hurricane Harvey is estimated to have cost $125 billion. Additionally, hurricanes such as Hurricane Harvey can have dramatic impacts on public health and safety. Eighty-two people are believed to have died as a result of Hurricane Harvey. Flood waters and damaged buildings can also have lasting impacts on public health due to contamination and increased growth of mold which can trigger asthma attacks or allergic reactions. As some of the largest refineries in the nation are located in the greater Houston area, hurricanes and tropical storms have the ability to greatly impact the nation's gasoline prices and an extended shutdown of  Houston-area refineries would likely cause shortages of fuel and pose a national security risk. About 13% of the nation's petroleum products are refined in the Houston area. Additionally, the high concentration of refineries and chemical manufacturing operations can cause toxic releases into the air and water. After Hurricane Harvey, more than 90 chemical releases were reported and estimated to have involved more than 700,000 gallons of pollutants being released into the water, and 38,000 pounds of pollutants being released into the air.

Groundwater withdrawals have caused about 3,200 square miles of the Houston-Galveston area to subside (or sink) more than a foot, with some areas subsiding as much as 12 to 13 feet. Over the last century, aquifers in this area have lost between 300 and 400 feet, leaving some of the land to collapse. Spring Branch, where Interstate 10 and Beltway 8 meet, has dropped four feet since 1975. Jersey Village, at US 290 and Beltway 8, is almost two feet lower than it was in 1996. And Greater Greenspoint, where Interstate 45 intersects with Beltway 8, has given up about two feet in the last decade, according to USGS data.Also according to the USGS, while some areas in Houston have significantly reduced their groundwater pumping (particularly with the creation of subsidence and groundwater districts, whose purpose is to regulate groundwater pumping), subsidence remains a threat for the region.

As a result demand can outstrip supply causing power outages. This risk may also increase water demand for cooling towers.  An increase in extreme heat could lead to power supply disruptions from programmed load shedding and heat damage to network infrastructure, causing brownouts and blackouts. This in turn reduces the reputation of the City in having a reliable power supply for its community and visitors.

This increases strain on emergency and social services supporting this sensitive population due to increases in demand coupled with a decrease in staffing resources.  An increase in extreme heat and associated impacts could reduce workforce productivity, as activities become too hot for people to work outside during parts of the day and the indoor thermal comfort is affected by pressures on cooling. It could lead to negative changes in behaviour in particular increases in violence and anti-social behaviour leading to an increase in demand for emergency and social services.   An increase in the extreme heat could lead to increases in heat impacts to transport infrastructure – resulting in congestion, major delays and mass transit disruption with potential stranding of commuters.  An increase in extreme heat could lead to changes in commuter behaviour opting to use private vehicles to access the CBD (rather than public transport) to avoid potential delays and discomfort resulting in increased congestion.

The potential impact of extreme heat on morbidity and mortality is concerning, in particular for vulnerable populations including those with pre-existing illness (e.g. pulmonary or cardiovascular disease), infants and young children, the elderly, the marginally housed, homeless and people who work outside.    An increase in the number of hot days will also exacerbate the need for air conditioning, thus placing a greater burden on the electrical system which could result in a potential brownout or blackout affecting thousands of Toronto residents.  Infrastructure implications include buckling and melting of highways and roads, mechanical failures, delays in travel times for commuters and the goods and services sector affecting supply and demand.Considerable attention has been placed on the issue of extreme heat and vulnerable populations.  During the COVID emergency special additional attention was paid to heat issues, with record setting duration of heat waves occurring simultaneously to the pandemic.   The pandemic coupled with extended hot weather exacerbates living conditions for vulnerable populations, placing a strain on social support systems.   Homeless shelters have expanded to new locations in an effort to improve social distancing of clients.   As much as hot weather makes outdoor living difficult when the cold weather arrives in the fall, it will be even more important to be able to provide housing to vulnerable populations when it will become possibly even more dangerous to live without proper shelter. An additional issue has been concerns over safety of window mounted air conditioners in apartment buildings causing a hazard if they fall.

The forest pest poses a great risk to Toronto's hardwood and shade trees. 42 percent of shade trees in Toronto are preferred by the ALHB, specifically maple trees. As a result, the potential impact on Toronto's forest canopy is high. Hardwoods and shade trees provide shade and beauty, shelter birds and animals, help filter air pollutants, produce oxygen, and increase property values which could all be at risk as a result of the ALHB infestation. Another risk to Toronto's tree canopy is the emerald ash borer. The City of Toronto's recent tree canopy study estimates that there are 860,000 ash trees in total on public and private lands. Inspections and systematic surveys in 2008-2011 have confirmed the EAB infestation throughout most parts of the City.A newer concern is due to Black Legged Ticks, which transmit Lyme Disease, which is associated with warmer temperatures and more breeding cycles of this insect pest.  West Nile Virus is also a concern, due to mosquitos carrying this disease which transmit the disease more effectively at warmer temperatures.

A key issue is flooding of residential basements.  Toronto does have an extensive basement flood protection program, which will take a decade or more to be implemented city wide.  There is a concern that critical infrastructure could be affected by flooding.  Cascade failure effects of infrastructure systems are not yet well understood (e.g. damage to telecom systems, electrical systems etc.) Basement flooding is increasingly a problem.  Low income people may not afford insurance or the cost of cleaning up and rebuilding.  More people are living in basement second suites and this increases the exposure of these lower income people.

Increasing	Increasing	Medium	Immediately	Vector-borne diseases are a less serious concern for Toronto. In recent years, West Nile Virus and Lyme disease have migrated northward posing increased risk to human health and specifically for Toronto residents - blacklegged ticks which transmit Lyme disease have been found in Toronto. The disease can affect the central nervous system, brain, joints or the heart affecting any age group.  West Nile Virus can affect anyone – however; the elderly, children and those with a weakened immune system are at greater risk. As the climate continues to warm, Toronto may experience an increased number of health implications linked to vector-borne diseases.Although the number of people affected currently is not high, the impact on individual people is considered sometimes to be extreme.   Lyme disease in particular has the threat of changing how much people spend time outdoors which will have other health and psychological effects.  (i.e. the benefits of being able to spend time in nature may decrease).

There are strong negative effects on inhabitants’ socialisation, children’s need to play outdoors in playgrounds and open spaces. There is also the danger of the potential use of public spaces for illegal activities, due to their abandonment during high temperatures. Furthermore, due to the energy poverty that many households face in the Municipality of Athens and the lack of air conditioning in many dwellings, in relation to the aged building stock, thermal discomfort can be observed in many buildings. This can lead to high morbidity and mortality risks of vulnerable groups of the population.During the past few years, the hot period starts earlier in spring and finishes later in autumn, leading to an increased number of hot days. Studies show that the number of days with temperatures more than 37-40oC has increased significantly after the 1990s. Electricity demand for cooling raises, while there are negative impacts mainly on vulnerable population’s health and generally decrease in people’s activities in the commercial city centre. These trends will deteriorate if appropriate measures are not taken.

The intensity of heat waves also shows a growing trend. As a result, in periods of extremely high temperatures there is an increasing number of medical incidences, higher morbidity and mortality risks, increase of energy consumption for cooling and negative effects on the commercial sector due to the limited activities and commuting in the city centre. Apart from that, the number of nights that tourists spent within the city decreases due to high temperatures. These trends will deteriorate if appropriate measures are not taken.

Subsidies have been provided by the state, while municipal and state taxes had been reduced for that period. At the same time, tourism, on which a lot of the economic domain of the city is based, is facing a serious decline, due to the ongoing pandemic.

En el caso de las zonas de sabana, con centro urbano consolidado,  la pérdida de coberturas vegetales que han sido reemplazada por construcciones en hormigón,  aumenta la frecuencia anual de eventos asociados a temperaturas extremas como las islas de calor urbanas.   Sin embargo, en zonas de tipo rural y/o con una presencia de mayor cobertura vegetal, esta probabilidad corresponde a un rango bajo, una vez cada 5 a 20 años. Con respecto a su impacto, este se clasifica como bajo, sin embargo, se debe considerar que  los impactos generados en Bogotá por esta amenaza, deben ser evaluados de acuerdo a la zona urbana o rural. Igualmente, las temperaturas extremas pueden propiciar eventos de escasez hídrica, pérdida de cultivos y cobertura vegetal, y afectación en la oferta alimentaria,  donde la zona rural es la mas vulnerable.  Se espera que para 2040 la temperatura incremente en 0,25°C en la zona rural y en el área urbana de 0,65°C. Con respecto a las precipitaciones, también se prevén principalmente aumentos en el porcentaje de cambio, pero al igual que ocurre con la temperatura, sus valores no son estándar para todo el Distrito Capital, teniendo en cuenta las diferentes características orográficas del territorio. De esta forma, mientras hacía el occidente de Bogotá D.C., se prevé que aumentará el porcentaje de lluvias hasta en 35% para 2040, hacia los cerros orientales y la zona sur de la localidad de Sumapaz se presentará un importante descenso en hasta 15%.

En este sector, cuando se presentan los cruces de los vientos alisios del sureste con masas de aire ascendentes de la Sabana hacia el oriente, y están acompañadas de suficiente humedad entrante desde la Orinoquía, el choque de las dos masas de aire da lugar a la formación de nubes de gran desarrollo vertical de tipo cumulonimbus, lo que sugiere una alta probabilidad de lluvias de cierta torrencialidad. En estos escenarios, hay un potencial incremento de las inundaciones en las localidades de San Cristóbal, Usaquén, Chapinero.  En la zona urbana, el Distrito Capital tiene una probabilidad de inundación por desbordamiento de los principales afluentes del río Bogotá: Río Fucha, Río Salitre y Río Tunjuelo por problemas derivados de las crecientes en dichas cuencas. Además, se calcula que 6.719 personas y el 30% del área urbana se encuentra con amenaza media, alta y baja de inundación, siendo las localidades de Bosa, Kennedy, Engativá; Fontibón, Suba, Tunjuelito, Rafael Uribe Uribe; Usme, Ciudad Bolívar y San Cristóbal las más afectadas y las que coinciden con las localidades que presentan mayores índices de pobreza, densidad poblacional y que se localizan cerca de humedales, riberas de los ríos y laderas de las montañas. El análisis de las condiciones de variabilidad climática Niño-Niña, indica que en los años con eventos Niña se presentaron un mayor número de emergencias por inundación, especialmente en los meses de abril y noviembre, sumando un total de 173 eventos en abril y 242 eventos en noviembre, durante el período de 2001 a 2019. . En el Distrito Capital, las proyecciones de precipitación a 2040 coinciden con el área de la localidad de Kennedy, en la que se han presentado mayores eventos históricos de inundaciones y encharcamientos, así como la totalidad de la localidad de Bosa, que pese a tener un régimen relativamente seco, con relación a otros puntos en la ciudad, las viviendas al estar localizadas por debajo de las cotas de inundación del Rio Tunjuelo constituyen zonas de alto riesgo de inundación.

En cuanto al impacto, los movimientos en masa pueden causar daño generalizado sobre los bienes, además de la muerte de personas, lo cual permite otorgarle un nivel alto. Las proyecciones de cambio en la precipitación para 2040, indican que en la parte occidental de la ciudad, se presentarán aumentos en los niveles de precipitación con relación a su promedio histórico, lo que sumado a las tendencias proyectadas en el cambio en los usos y ocupación del suelo, que responden a necesidades como el mejoramiento de la conectividad vial, la cobertura de servicios y la migración de habitantes hacia zonas de alto riesgo no mitigable, aumentará la ocurrencia de movimientos en masa en dicha zona.

Environment, biodiversity, forestry; Residential; Transport	Children & youth; Elderly; Low-income households; Marginalized groups; Persons with chronic diseases	Increasing	Increasing	High	Medium-term (2026-2050)	El histórico de la ocurrencia de incendios forestales  tiene una frecuencia de varias veces al año, esto de acuerdo con el régimen bimodal de la ciudad, asociado al aumento de la temperatura en la temporada de menos lluvias. El impacto de la amenaza climática por incendios forestales, dependiendo de la magnitud y frecuencia, genera consecuencias tanto en las personas, como en los bienes y los servicios.  En este sentido, hay una afectación directa a las personas asociada a enfermedades respiratorias, ocasionadas por la afectación a la calidad del aire; sin embargo, es importante aclarar que en dicha afectación influye la variabilidad climática. Por otra parte, se ha presentado interrupción de servicios en lo corrido de los últimos 10 años, ocasionando evacuaciones, aumento en los costos de la respuesta y cierres temporales de diferentes servicios (recreativos, turísticos, entre otros). Finalmente, la afectación de los ecosistemas es alta, ya que genera desplazamiento y/o muerte de vegetación y fauna. Como conclusión, el impacto generado por dichos eventos es alto. El análisis futuro de la ocurrencia de incendios forestales parte de la inferencia de que, si la temperatura aumenta y la precipitación disminuye, en igual medida, el suelo y la vegetación tendrán menos humedad, lo que los hará más susceptibles al fuego y, por ende, la intensidad y severidad de la amenaza por incendios forestales serán mayores. Lo anterior se sustenta en los resultados del cruce de las coberturas de amenaza por incendios forestales con los escenarios de precipitación y temperatura proyectados por el IDEAM, 2017 a 2040, lo cual indica que las zonas que tendrán mayor amenaza climática por incendios forestales  a 2040 en Bogotá serán parte del Parque Ecológico Distrital de Montaña Entrenubes (en las UPZ 60 Parque Entrenubes, 51 Los Libertadores, 55 Diana Turbay, 56 Danubio y 57 Gran Yomasa), parte de los Cerros Orientales (UPR que lleva el mismo nombre) y sectores de las Unidades de Planeamiento Rural (UPR) Cuenca del Río Blanco y Cuenca del Río Sumapaz en la localidad 20 de Sumapaz.

A nivel rural, los cerros orientales que presentan alta pendiente tienen condiciones naturales que permiten la generación de avenidas torrenciales, lo que sumado a las precipitaciones que se presentan en las dos temporadas de lluvias de la ciudad, producen volúmenes de agua suficientes que pueden ocasionar flujos torrenciales, incrementando la susceptibilidad del Distrito a este tipo de amenaza.   De manera particular, la existencia de pendientes altas a lo largo del recorrido del río Sumapaz en su parte alta, genera la probabilidad del desarrollo de crecientes fuertes en corto tiempo, que originan un régimen torrencial con la consecuente presencia de deslizamientos y avalanchas asociadas al transporte de materiales de diferentes espesores. Aun cuando no se cuenta con registros históricos de eventos por avenidas torrenciales en la localidad de Sumapaz, las condiciones anteriormente mencionadas generan alta probabilidad de eventos por avenidas torrenciales, teniendo en cuenta la riqueza hídrica en esta zona y las condiciones orográficas.  En el área urbana, el mayor número de avenidas torrenciales se presentó en el año 2016, con 11 eventos registrados a diferencia del año 2019 y 2020, en los que se presentó 1 evento en cada año. Algunos de los eventos de mayor importancia por las emergencias que generaron ocurrieron en las quebradas Peña Colorada, La Trompeta, Chiguaza y Limas, Teniendo en cuenta la disminución de la precipitación proyectada en 2040 en las localidades de Chapinero, Santa Fe y San Cristóbal (las cuales tienen área de su jurisdicción en la UPR Cerros Orientales), así como en la parte suroriental de la localidad de Sumapaz, llevan a inferir que se reducirá la incidencia de avenidas torrenciales en estas zonas. Sin embargo, estos resultados difieren del mapa de amenazas por avenidas torrenciales, lo que sugiere que se requiere profundizar el análisis de esta amenaza climática en una escala diferencial respecto de los escenarios climáticos, considerando, entre otros factores, las proyecciones de aumento en la presión en los usos del suelo, producto de las actividades agrícolas, ganaderas y en los procesos de expansión urbanística hacia los Cerros Orientales, lo que podría detonar eventos de avenidas torrenciales.

Los impactos incluyen inundaciones, daños a los árboles, a la infraestructura pública (como iluminación, edificios, instalaciones públicas) y comercios. Además, estos eventos afectan los servicios urbanos, como la recolección de residuos y el transporte público, que se pueden ver interrumpidos por este fenómeno climático .

La tendencia de aumento en el nivel de las aguas del Río de la Plata es de 1,7 mm/año. Como consecuencia, hay impactos humanos y sociales, así como pérdidas materiales, especialmente en asentamientos informales cercanos al río, o comercios y domicilios afectados en zonas de arroyos entubados, tal es el caso del desbordamiento del Arroyo Maldonado y Aº Vega ocurrido en el año 2012 (IDOM, 2020). En relación al riesgo de inundación fluvial y pluvial, los niveles de riesgo relativamente más altos sobre el hábitat urbano se localizan fundamentalmente al área inundable del Riachuelo, como también la zona en riesgo alto asociada al arroyo Maldonado (IDOM, 2020).  Las consecuencias de estos eventos se reflejan en problemas en la salud, daños a la infraestructura de edificios e instalaciones comerciales, daños a equipamientos públicos (escuelas, hospitales, etc.), cortes o interrupciones de servicios como electricidad, transporte público y recolección de residuos.

Este fenómeno aumenta el nivel del Río de la Plata. Es un viento fuerte que sopla en de la dirección opuesta al flujo normal del Río de la Plata, bloqueando su drenaje normal empujando el agua hacia la costa y provocando así inundaciones. En general la sudestada es acompañada por lluvias, condición que agrava aún más el escenario. Sumado a esto, las tendencias señalan un aumento en el nivel de las aguas del Río de la Plata de 1,7 mm/año.Frente a esto, la ciudad dispone de un sistema de alerta temprana, que brinda información en tiempo real sobre la lluvia y los  efectos de las tormentas en diferentes puntos de la ciudad. En la misma línea, la Ciudad de Buenos Aires tiene una red de alerta meteorológica administrada por el Centro Único de Coordinación y Control. Dentro del Plan de Emergencia, las Sudestadas son considerados una de las amenazas climáticas que enfrenta Buenos Aires, por lo tanto tiene protocolos de actuación para abordar la problemática. Si bien el fenómeno no puede evitarse, se han desarrollado medidas que la ciudad esté mejor preparada en caso de ocurrencia, o bien para mitigar sus consecuencias, entre ellas: mejoras en la infraestructura hidráulica de la Ciudad; capacitaciones para responder a las emergencias y vecinos capacitados como “primeros respondedores”, y mejoras en el sistema pluvial (bombas, limpieza de ductos, etc) para minimizar el impacto."

Este fenómeno puede acelerar el aumento del nivel del río en Buenos Aires y que se produzcan inundaciones y anegamientos con mayor facilidad. La Sudestada provoca daños en la infraestructura, caída de árboles, alumbrado público, cortes de energía y la interrupción de los servicios urbanos. En las últimas décadas, el Río de la Plata ha experimentado un incremento en su nivel medio debido al aumento del nivel del mar (17 cm en la última década) y, en menor medida, al cambio en la dirección de los vientos estacionales y al incremento en el caudal de los ríos tributarios (D’Onofrio et al., 2003)."

Dias consecutivos com chuva tem potencial para causar eventos extremos de deslizamentos. Já muitos dias sem chuva têm potencial para causar secas, bem como reduzir a umidade relativa do ar e provocar doenças respiratórias. A falta de chuvas, além de interferir na queda da umidade, dificulta a dispersão dos poluentes, aumentando sua quantidade no meio ambiente, e cada vez mais prejudicando a qualidade de vida da população. Outro dado importante se refere a máxima precipitação em um dia (recorde registrado no ano). Este é um importante dado, pois demonstra a possibilidade de eventos extremos de enchentes e inundações. Segundo a modelagem, em quase todos os anos, a cidade de Curitiba deverá ter ao menos um episódio de chuva considerada como muito forte (acima de 55,3 mm).

Diferentemente da seca, que tem duração permanente, a estiagem é sazonal. Por conta da falta de água, principal impacto negativo da estiagem, a prioridade de abastecimento passa a ser o ser humano, podendo comprometer as outras atividades (agricultura, serviços, indústria). O setor de energia também pode ser impactado, fazendo com que usinas térmicas sejam acionadas. Isto torna a tarifa mais cara e aumenta a emissão de GEE da matriz energética brasileira. Mesmo que a estiagem não ocorra na cidade, o impacto na tarifa de energia elétrica pode afetar os curitibanos, em função do Sistema Interligado Nacional. Também pode haver aumento de preço de produtos agropecuários,  caso a estiagem prejudique a produção destes produtos.

Como consecuencia, se han producido impactos en la salud: estrés cardiovascular, las afecciones al sistema nervioso y los problemas respiratorias.Se espera que el impacto del peligro en el futuro produzca una reducción del confort térmico en la población, afectando igualmente al turismo, además, posibles enfermedades, que van desde calambres hasta golpes de calor, posible aumento de la mortalidad y morbilidad, incremento de enfermedades por vectores sanitarios y diarreicas, lo que reducirá la capacidad de respuesta de los centros de salud, reducción de la dispersión de contaminantes atmosféricos, posible impacto económico-ecológico por aumento de las necesidades de refrigeración en las nuevas viviendas . Además se espera un posible aumento puntual en el consumo energético y pérdida económica de forma indirecta en el sector industria y comercio. En el sector infraestructura, se esperan daños  físicos a la vialidad por reblandecimiento del asfalto y aparición de roderas y fisuras, posibles daños a las juntas de unión por dilatación excesiva y un posible impacto económico por aumento de las necesidades de mantenimiento de la infraestructura. Por último, se preveé un impacto en los espaciona naturales debido a la posible afección a hábitats y especies por aumento de incendios.Según las proyecciones, la temperatura anual máxima muestra un valor medio que fluctúa entre 21ºC y 26ºC bajo el escenario RCP 4.5 y entre 21ºC y 27ºC bajo el escenario RCP 8.5. La temperatura anual mínima, por su parte, registra un valor medio que varía entre 10ºC y 19ºC tanto para ambos escenarios. En ambos casos, la temperatura disminuye a medida que aumenta la distancia con respecto al mar.

La recurrencia de estos fenómenos y su capacidad para generar daño hace que sean considerados como principales peligros. Entre los movimientos en masa más frecuentes se encuentran los derrumbes (26%). Este tipo de peligro consiste en el desplome de material a partir de una superficie de rotura irregular, son muy repentinos y extremadamente rápidos; sin embargo, puede deberse también a eventos sísmicos o antigüedad/deterioro de las construcciones. Los huaycos o flujo de detritos son el segundo tipo de peligro más recurrente dentro de los movimientos en masa (15%). Son movimientos que ocurren pendiente abajo cuando se ocasiona la pérdida de cohesión interna del suelo por efecto combinado de la precipitación y la gravedad. Los deslizamientos, por su parte, son desplazamientos lentos y progresivos de tierra, rocas y sedimentos, pendiente abajo y suceden por las características del suelo (dureza, filtraciones, humedad, pendiente,entre otros). En Lima Metropolitana se han recogido 157 eventos durante el periodo 1970-2017.Los huaycos o flujos de lodo se han producido en las quebradas secas que han sido activadas en la cuenca alta por lluvias de carácter excepcional o durante el fenómeno de El Niño. Entre los años 1970 y 2017, el distrito de Lurigancho ha registrado el mayor número de eventos (44 eventos); sin embargo, también han sido visibles en otras áreas, como las quebradas Huaycán, Quirio, Pedregal y La Cantuta en Chosica-Lurigancho (durante los años 1982, 1983, 1998 y 2012) o las quebradas de Huaycoloro y Media en San Juan de Lurigancho. La susceptibilidad a los deslizamientos se localiza principalmente a lo largo de las laderas de los valles de los ríos principales de las tres cuencas (Chillón, Rímac y Lurín) y en los distritos de Villa María del Triunfo, Lima, Magdalena del Mar y Rímac Los movimientos en masa muestran un incremento en la peligrosidad con respecto al periodo histórico. Las zonas con una alta  susceptibilidad se localizan en las altitudes más altas y en las laderas de los cerros. Por el contrario, la zona costera se caracteriza por presentar un nivel bajo de peligrosidad a movimientos en masa.

En lo que respecta a las precipitaciones, son cuatro factores: corriente Humboldt, Cordillera de los Andes, topografía y el efecto continentalidad son los que determinan la condición desértica de Lima Metropolitana, que se ve, a su vez, afectada por las precipitaciones provenientes de las cuencas altas. Según la climatología de referencia utilizada para el estudio de SENAMHI (2015), la precipitación total anual presenta, en general, una precipitación inferior a 50 mm e incrementa con la altitud alcanzando valores máximos de 178 mm.En la proyección climática futura se encontro que la precipitación anual total muestra valores medios de entre 25 mm y 161 mm bajo el escenario RCP 4.5 y entre 30mm y 200 mm bajo el escenario RCP 8.5 (Figura 49). Su comportamiento es similar al registrado durante el periodo histórico, ya que se observa un incremento gradual en las precipitaciones a medida que se aumenta la distancia con respecto a la costa.Así mismo, existe una variabilidad en el nivel de peligrosidad de sequías bajo el escenario RCP 4.5. El motivo se debe a un comportamiento variable en la precipitación bajo este escenario ya que la temperatura muestra un incremento uniforme en toda la provincia. Así, las zonas con mayor peligrosidad son aquellas áreas donde se recoge una disminución en la precipitación con respecto al periodo histórico; mientras que las áreas con una menor peligrosidad son las que manifiestan un aumento en lasprecipitaciones con respecto al periodo histórico. Por otro lado, el escenario RCP 8.5, muestra en su gran mayoría un nivel de riesgo bajo o moderado debido principalmente a que existe un mayor incremento en las precipitaciones durante este escenario climático. No obstante, cabe destacar que esta variable presenta una alta incertidumbre en el territorio; por tanto, los resultados obtenidos bajo este escenario están sujetos también a dicha incertidumbre.

Este peligro se produce cuando la capacidad normal de conducción de ríos es sobrepasada por grandes volúmenes de agua. Como consecuencia, se produce el anegamiento de zonas normalmente emergidas, como son las zonas bajas de quebradas o planas de la ciudad. El resto de los fenómenos hidrometeorológicos y oceanográficos, presentan un porcentaje menor al 6%. Si se analiza distrito a distrito, el Cercado de Lima ha sido el que ha registrado el mayor número de peligros (151 eventos) durante el periodo 1970-2017, seguido de los distritos de Lurigancho y Ate con 112 y 72 eventos respectivamente, seguido de los distritos de Rímac, Chaclacayo, Independencia, San Juan de Lurigancho, El Agustino, Chorrillos, Puente Piedra y Carabayllo con entre 32 y 64 eventos, y por último, el resto con menos de 27 eventos durante el periodo analizado. Las inundaciones han ocurrido en zonas bajas de quebradas, así como en las zonas planas de la ciudad durante lluvias intensas. Los distritos de Lurigancho, Rímac y el Cercado de Lima son los que mayor número de eventos han registrado debido a la crecida y desborde de los ríos Rímac y el canal Surco. Entre los principales impactos que se han observado, se encuentran el anegamiento de las viviendas y el colapso de las redes de alcantarillado, pozos y captaciones de agua.Los resultados obtenidos en el escenario RCP 4.5 reflejan en general ligeros cambios en zonas de peligro alto. Así, en la cuenca del Río Chillón aparecen cambios en el entorno de la ribera del río en distritos como Carabayllo, y en el curso principal en distritos como Puente Piedras y Comas. En la cuenca del río Rímac también resultan cambios en zonas de peligro alto en el entorno del río en los distritos Chaclacayo, Lurigancho y Ate. En el centro urbano también se observan ligeros cambios en el distrito de Lima. Referente a la zona del Río Lurín, los cambios más significativos se observan en la desembocadura del río, localizada en el distrito de Lurín.El escenario RCP 8.5 sigue una tendencia similar al escenario anterior, incrementando ligeramente el nivel del peligro en zonas como San Martin de Porres (cuenca del río Chillón), los distritos de Rímac y Lima Centro (cuenca del río Rímac) y en el distrito Lurín (desembocadura del río Lurín).

Un ejemplos de enfermedades que aquejan a la población, potenciada por el cambio climático, es el dengue, el cual con el aumento en las lluvias favorece la reproducción del mosquito. Además, el calentamiento global acelera el desarrollo del virus, amplía la zona de influencia del mosquito y su capacidad de adaptarse a temperaturas más frías.

It's important to highlight that Milan water management policies are decreasing the impact of river floods thanks to an efficient drainage network.

A correlation seems to exist between gender and mortality rates during heatwaves, in fact during 2003 Paris heatwave, mortality rates were greater among women, whilst a very high rate was discovered among working men, which suggests that the working environment influences vulnerability.Heatwaves also cause higher energy demand for cooling by creating a general discomfot. In the last years. this fact  forced the energy management agency (Unareti) to issue a warning to reduce energy consumption in order to prevent blackouts: in 2015, due to the high temperature,  a peak in energy demand was registered  in the city (1.625 MW), causing several failures in the energy distribution network.

In fact infrastructures are one of the most sensitive elements when exposed to floods and, considering that vehicle circulation slows down, emergency services are affected.Heavy rainfall damages green areas and natural environment as well, fact that could negatively affect the city in case two or more rain storms happen consecutively.

Due to the rising of average global temperatures, heavy snow probability is decreasing in Milan, but due to the unpredictability of climate behaviour it would be incorrect to expect the climate hazard to disappear completely.

When compared to the rest of the Po basin, Milan's peculiarity is that fog is disappearing from there: this anomaly is caused by the higher temperatures and the lower relative humidity in the city.

Data collected by those stations shows that wind intensity actually increased in average 1 m/s in Brera, with a frequency increase of six seasonal events over the 95th percentile (calculated on the wind intensity recorded in Brera between 01/01/2015 and 31/12/2018). Data also shows that the average wind intensity in Lambrate didn't change, while the severe wind events frequency actually decreased in the last five years, even though the frequency change was too small to be considered relevant: availables data is not enough to make assumptions about wind in relation to climate change, but it could suggests that the wind intensity did not actually change and the change in Brera could have been caused by morphological factors.

The other main social category affected by extreme winter conditions are homeless people, which are the most vulnerable to low temperatures: for this reason very winter the city of Milan puts in place the Plan Against Cold, a protocol for the opening of reception centers for the homeless people. As highlighted in the Local Climate Profile, the amount of frost nights has decreased in the past years and it's going to be even lower in 2050.

This change doesn't threaten Milan's access to water resources since the city is very rich in underground water, but it can be an issue for air quality, since rain captures air pollutants and cleans the atmosphere, and for agriculture, biodiversity and natural environment.

In fact, most of the forest fires registered by the Forest Rangers take place in the northern side of the region, where the amount of forest fires per year decreased by 100 between 1975 and 2015. Forecasting the changes in this trend is not simple because, while laws and enforcement become more effective, temperatures are rising and the forestation plan is going to increase the number of trees in the city.

Milan suffers from this problem as well, but, considering that the sewage network is very efficient, this issue in particular manifests itself through localized floodings, which slightly affect the traffic conditions and the viability of certain pedestrian areas. but do not cause severe damages as it happens for river floodings. This kind of phenomenon affects the sewage system as well, which has to treat more water than it's actually necessary and wears over time.

This is a problem for underground services, but moostly for the subway, which reaches lower depths than other infrastructures (eg. energy distribution network). This problem is expected to worsen due to the new regional law for hydraulic invariance -RR n. 07, 23 November 2017- which issues a set of standards that every city has to apply in order to reduce the amount of rain water directed to the sewage network, draining it naturally through permeable soil: this rule, which is going to alleviate the problem of the surface runoff, is expected to challenge the city of Milan on the underground infrastructures use.

Until now no evidence shows the presence of the Legionella virus, but Milan and MM SpA established the guidelines to prevent this virus from spreading in the water distribution network.

All these diseases are related to mosquitos, which are expected to grow in number due to the rising of temperatures, therefore it is possible that the future reported number of cases per year is going to increase. Due to Italian Healthcare system, the diseases are preventable, curable or at least the syntoms can be treated until the spontaneous healing, therefore the consequences of the hazard are not severe.

Milan is the most affected city in the whole nation, with a 10% of the overall number of infections. In this moment the infection rate is low, but it is not clear how the situation will evolve. The illness mostly affects senior citizens, in fact mortality rate for people between 80 and 89 years old is 33.2% against the 0.1% mortality rate for people between 20 and 29 years old.Regarding other illnesses, compared to the other Italian regions, Lombardy is one of the most affected ones by measles and chickenpox, and the number of reported cases are extremely variable every year (measles: 433 cases in 2013 and 106 in 2014 - chickenpox: 19820 cases in 2012 and 24417 in 2013).

In 2015, observation of the tiger mosquito in Paris, followed by mosquito control operations. From 2016, implementation of reinforced entomological surveillance. Implantation of the tiger mosquito in Paris at the end of 2018, with no cases of indigenous arbovirosis reported. This is linked in particular to a vector population that is too low and concentrated in a single district on the outskirts of Paris. The common mosquito Culex sp. which can be a vector of the West Nile virus, is already established in Paris, but the virus is not circulating there. This arbovirosis, on the other hand, has been present in the Mediterranean basin for several years. The strengthening of the role of water and nature in cities as part of adaptation to climate change entails an increased risk of the tiger mosquito becoming established or of the stronger presence of the common mosquito. Preventive actions (surveillance of mosquito implantation or control once the mosquito has been implanted, investigations following reported cases, training of health professionals, public information, etc.), within the framework of national regulations, which are the responsibility of the ARS (Régional Health Agengy), are also increasing and could limit the risk. The city has an expert entomologist, who is responsible for communication on the fight against mosquito nuisances for city employees (high-risk occupations) and the public, and participates in coordination on surveillance and vector control. This issue is taken into account in several city policies (Environmental health Plan, Biodiversity Plan, Local health contract, Resilience Strategy, etc.) and in urban projects.The incidence of Lyme borreliosis is relatively low in Ile-de-France compared to other French regions. However, it seems to be on the increase in metropolitan France and there is a risk of expansion in Paris for several reasons: movement of ticks northwards (and in altitude) due to climatic changes (milder winters, too hot and dry summers in southern regions), increase in the period of tick activity, increase in nature in cities (favourable to the presence of ticks), increase in activities in forests/parks.

It is particularly present in tropical climates, but its incidence has increased in recent years in temperate climates and particularly in metropolitan France (1 case/100,000 inhabitants). In Paris, the populations most at risk are sewer workers, agents working in the water and sanitation sector, road cleaning agents, and park and garden agents, who become contaminated through contact of the skin or mucous membranes with water contaminated with rat urine. Preventive measures are put in place to protect agents working in high-risk occupations (wearing personal protective equipment, recommended vaccination).People practising recreational and sports activities in fresh water (swimming, water sports) are also at risk and awareness must be raised. At the moment, contamination linked to water activities has not been detected in Paris or the Ile-de-France region, but the risk exists in the event of contamination of bodies of water by the bacteria. In Paris, the fight against the proliferation of rats is helping to limit the spread of the disease, as are the various studies carried out to gain a better understanding of the areas infested with carrier rats and the strains mostly found. The presence of leptospires has been detected at several points (Seine, canal, water bodies of green spaces) without any link being made with the cases occurring among Parisians.The impact on health linked to contact with non-potable water or wastewater containing pathogens mainly concerns certain professionals (sewer workers, water and sanitation professionals, urban cleaning agents, parks and gardens agents, etc.).  Surface water or non-potable water used in Paris for street cleaning, watering green spaces or ornamental fountains, may contain pathogens, leptospires, waterborne pathogens, cyanobacteria and microalgae, etc.  Currently, there is very little contact with non-drinking water for the Parisian population (only 1 bathing site in a basin fed by a canal with microbiological water quality control during the season open to bathing + possible exposure via ornamental fountains or wetlands in parks and gardens) but the project to develop bathing sites in ""natural water"" could increase the risk in the coming years. Lack of hindsight on the risk related to possible exposure to Sars-COV2 through non-potable water."

Increasing	Do not know	Medium	Short-term (by 2025)	A change in pollination has been observed over the last 30 years, with in particular an increase in the amount of pollen emitted, positively correlated to the increase in temperature. This is the case, for example, for birch, a highly allergenic taxon present in Paris, which has seen its pollen concentration increase over the last few decades. However, these results remain contrasted and do not apply to all plants (e.g. grasses). Similarly, the beginning and end of pollination as well as the length of the season tend to evolve, but the study over the last thirty years does not show a general trend of precocity or delay, and must be observed taxon by taxon and geographical site by site. The increase in temperature could also allow the establishment of certain allergenic species in new regions (particularly for herbaceous species that move more rapidly), promote pollen production and make pollen more allergenic (increase in allergen quantities).The allergic risk associated with pollen exposure is monitored by the City and the National Aerobiological Monitoring Network (NAMN), and the results are communicated to the public and health professionals to help limit the impact on health. In addition, the City's vegetalization policy takes into account the allergic risk in the choice of plant species planted.The standardized incidence of legionellosis in Paris has been relatively stable since 2012, but slightly higher than the Paris Region and national average. Warmer and more humid weather conditions could be a factor favouring the survival and dispersal of legionella in the environment. With warmer summers, the increased presence of fogging facilities, which can cause contaminating exposure of the population, could increase the risk. For air-conditioning, the risk exists mainly through air-cooling towers if they are wet cooling, but these are decreasing in Paris.The city has the technical means (laboratory) to monitor its installations at risk of legionella (water networks for swimming pools, shower baths, stadiums, cooling equipment such as misters, etc.). The monitoring of Establishments receiving the public (ERP) and the replacement of wet cooling towers by dry cooling towers, contribute to the control of the risk.

During a heat wave, rates of emergency department visitation and hospitalization increase, as well as heat-related deaths. In addition, many housing units do not in San Francisco metropolitan area have access to air conditioning or other cooling mechanisms. Heat waves overwhelm the work of hospitals and other health providers. The elderly, the very young, and those with chronic health problems are most at risk when extreme heat occurs. Severe heat waves lead to increase in electricity demand for cooling and the city’s electric reliability may be more vulnerable.

The stormwater system may also be disrupted when debris blocks inlets or pipes and low-lying areas may be flooded. Stormwater ponding can create a pollution problem during heavy rain storms as floodwaters carry debris, chemicals, trash, and other pollutants that have collected on streets. This disrupts the normal operation of city’s waste management and transportation systems, along with posing sanitation risks. Because the City has a combine sewer and storm drain system rainfall runoff can have consequences on both infrastructure and public health

San Francisco’s AQI was over 150 for 12 straight days, peaking at 228. This wildfire smoke  emergency caused significant disruption as schools were canceled. It is likely that the wildfire smoke emergency impacts were not evenly distributed as residents with access to air filtration were less exposed to wildfire smoke.

Um dos símbolos desta crise é a diminuição drástica do Sistema Cantareira, imenso reservatório administrado pela Sabesp e responsável pelo abastecimento de água de cerca de 8,8 milhões de pessoas. A seca na Região Sudeste, em associação a fatores ligados à infraestrutura e planejamento, é a responsável pela pior crise hídrica enfrentada pela região. A atuação da Sabesp na crise foi criticada em um artigo publicado pela revista PlOS ONE. A partir de dados da própria empresa foi constatado que a gestão dos recursos hídricos pela Sabesp é uma das principais responsáveis pela crise. O cenário de crise ameaça gerar sérios problemas principalmente à Região Metropolitana de São Paulo (RMSP), que tem cerca de 20 milhões de pessoas, Em virtude de seu imenso tamanho e valor industrial, a RMSP enfrenta diversos desafios quando se trata de gerir seus recursos hídricos. A área metropolitana importa cerca de metade de seu abastecimento de água da Bacia do Rio Piracicaba na área metropolitana de Campinas em direção ao norte.O nível das represas sofreu forte queda e baixa principalmente por causa da estiagem registrada no estado de São Paulo e nas cabeceiras das represas.  Urge que o governo do Estado e municipal realizem as ações preventivas e de recuperação da potabilidade do sistema hídrico local, com recuperação das nascentes, córregos, rios e represas.

The increase in the incidence of heatwaves and extreme heat is expected to adversely impact the health, safety and well-being of vulnerable members of the community. These include members of the community who are already vulnerable due to poor mental or physical health, the elderly, those who are isolated by a lack of mobility or transport options and/or are highly dependent on particular facilities or support. Increased heatwaves and extreme heat will also influence Adelaide’s amenity and attraction as a place to live, do business and visit.Visitation and corresponding commercial and retail activity to outdoor activity centres is likely to reduce during extreme climate events such as heatwaves, thereby impacting on local businesses and the economy. Conversely visitation to indoor environments may increase, as people seek out or retreat to protected areas to socialise and shop. Participation in events, celebrations and activities will also be impacted. Continuity of services may be affected due to disruptions to electricity services.

Remnant native vegetation may experience declining condition as a result of drying, plant loss, decreased germination, introduction of disease and may also be damaged by bushfire. Existing biodiversity threats, including pest plants and animals, may become greater as pest plants and animals are often opportunistic and have a greater ability to respond to disturbance than native species. The effect will vary for open and green spaces across the Region depending on their access to irrigation.

Denver is within the South Platte River Basin - the most populous basin in the state. Projections estimate that the population in the basin may nearly double from about 3.5 million people to 6 million people by 2050.  Approximately 85 percent of Colorado’s population resides in the South Platte Basin, and the Front Range area of the basin is Colorado’s economic and social engine. The South Platte River Basin also has the greatest concentration of irrigated agricultural lands in Colorado.  Demands for water and limited new supplies will have an impact on water availability in the coming years.

In 2017, the Denver metro area was hit by the costliest hailstorm in state history with over 2.3 Billion USD in damage. These storms also lead to increased stress on stormwater management and flood control.  While wildfire costs and destruction garner headlines, damage from hailstorms are more costly and have greater potential for property damage.

High levels of mortality due to cold weather is often more severe in temperate regions than in colder regions because the former do not have the built environment to adapt to extreme cold. Cold waves are very dangerous for the vulnerable members of St. Louis' population, including the elderly and children. The aging population has an increased vulnerability to severe cold weather events. Increased mortality, as well as, rates of respiratory and cardiovascular disease associated with cold spells is stronger in those aged 65 and older.  Older citizens also account for almost half of hypothermia-induced deaths in St. Louis. About 10-15 deaths per year have occurred due to hypothermia in St. Louis, though temperature related outcomes are difficult to measure, due to the many other risk factors for disease and thus may be understated. Individuals with pre-existing health conditions, including metabolic and cardiovascular conditions, are more susceptible to physical changes in the body due to cold weather. Those with chronic respiratory diseases are at increased risk of death during extreme weather conditions. In St. Louis City, 45.1 deaths out of 100,000 persons were attributed to chronic respiratory diseases, more than the United States average of 40.1 deaths out of 100,000 persons, for the years 2011-2015.97 These subgroups also tend to have increased difficulty accessing health care and public health infrastructure during extreme weather events.  North St. Louis and other areas of the City have high percentages of low income populations  that may live in sub-standard housing, not have the financial ability to afford consistent heating, regular housing, medical treatment, or warm clothing during cold months, which will make them more susceptible to hypothermia, respiratory disease, and cardiac events.  Business and school closures during extreme cold or snow/ice also have negative economic impacts on individuals that depend on those jobs for income.

Drought in St. Louis is projected to happen more frequently in the future as the climate changes and extreme weather becomes more severe.   Those who will be the most vulnerable to increased frequency and severity of drought are African Americans living below the poverty line. Poor housing quality and infrastructure plus financial instability place impoverished people of color in a more dangerous situation when hazards like drought occur. The impacts of drought on human health are broad, ranging from immediate compromised water quality to long-term diminished living conditions related to energy, air quality, and hygiene.  Although many of the effects of drought are indirect, various social, environmental, and healthfactors are severely complicated during periods of drought. Considerations should be made for malnutrition, and water-related diseases in the region.

On average, St. Louis experiences four more heat waves each summer than it has in the past. Since 1970, the number of extreme heat days in St. Louis has increased by 6.4 days. By 2030, St. Louis is expected to experience 46 danger days, and 63 danger days by 2050.  Higher urban temperatures are associated with higher levels of air pollution and greenhouse gases, like ground-level ozone, which exacerbate asthma and other respiratory diseases. Asthma is the number one reason for hospitalization of St. Louis children at St. Louis Children’sHospital. In 2015, the rate of asthma-related emergency room visits among African American children was 8.5 times greater than that of White children.

The aging population has an increased vulnerability to severe cold weather events. Increased mortality, as well as, rates of respiratory and cardiovascular disease associated with cold spells is stronger in those aged 65 and older.  Older citizens also account for almost half of hypothermia-induced deaths in St. Louis. About 10-15 deaths per year have occurred due to hypothermia in St. Louis, though temperature related outcomes are difficult to measure, due to the many other risk factors for disease and thus may be understated. Individuals with pre-existing health conditions, including metabolic and cardiovascular conditions, are more susceptible to physical changes in the body due to cold weather. Those with chronic respiratory diseases are at increased risk of death during extreme weather conditions. In St. Louis City, 45.1 deaths out of 100,000 persons were attributed to chronic respiratory diseases, more than the United States average of 40.1 deaths out of 100,000 persons, for the years 2011-2015.97 These subgroups also tend to have increased difficulty accessing health care and public health infrastructure during extreme weather events.  North St. Louis and other areas of the City have high percentages of low income populations  that may live in sub-standard housing, not have the financial ability to afford consistent heating, regular housing, medical treatment, or warm clothing during cold months, which will make them more susceptible to hypothermia, respiratory disease, and cardiac events.  Business and school closures during extreme cold or snow/ice also have negative economic impacts on individuals that depend on those jobs for income.

Extreme storm water flooding issues in the City caused the EPA to require the Metropolitan Sewer District to spend $100 million on green infrastructure, as a part of a 2011 settlement of a Clean Water Act lawsuit with the Environmental Protection Agency and the Missouri Coalition for the Environment.  Major flooding that occurred in the St. Louis region (just south of the City) during the winter of 2016 caused a sewage overflow of about 200 million gallons, one of the largest in the United States over the last couple years.  In 2015 and 2017, flooding near the City shutdown two major highways (44 & 55) that lead to the City.

The City of St. Louis is at a high risk for tornado impact. In the half century between 1950 to 2006, there were three recorded tornadoes within the City of St. Louis.135 In contrast, during the decade between 2007 and 2017, there were four tornadoes recorded within city limits.  Overall, vulnerability to tornadoes is moderate in City of St. Louis.  Although the City has low numbers of mobile homes (structures most vulnerable), the City does have high concentrations of low-income and elderly, both of which may have lower ability to respond to warnings.  These populations are also less likely to have property insurance.  Power outages caused by high winds or tornadoes has caused some individuals to use other alternative sources of energy that might increase respiratory asphyxiation and carbon-monoxide poisonings.  In addition, windstorms pose a significant risk of death and morbidity due to electrocution.

As the climate warms and more moisture can be held in the atmosphere, individual winter storms will become heavier with more snowfall per storm. Ice storms, like those experienced in eastern Canada today, will also begin to occur in Calgary. Ice storms in particular can damage infrastructure and cause power failure (e.g. downing of overhead powerlines), increase the change of multi-day service disruptions, and result in more injuries due to increased traffic accidents, or slipping and falling. The latter is a particular concern as Calgary’s population ages and is more at risk of serious injury due to falls.  In the event of a multi-day disruption to public services, citizens may be at risk if they cannot access ambulance and fire services.

Increased freeze-thaw cycle, leading to weather related damages to infrastructure and assets (public and private).  Increased severity of extreme winter conditions, leading to damage to infrastructure and assets (public and private).  Freezing precipitation in the form of freezing rain and drizzle, resulting in ice accretion on exposed surfaces, requires even more specific conditions to occur. Freezing precipitation requires the presence of an elevated layer of warmer air above 0°C, deep enough to melt falling precipitation, but with sub-zero surface conditions sufficient to cool liquid precipitation and cause it to freeze on contact with and accumulate on surfaces such as trees and overhead communication and electrical infrastructure. Data recorded at Calgary International Airport already suggests these events appear to be an emerging hazard for the region; one that infrastructure in southern Alberta is not designed to withstand.

However, Calgary is on the fringe of the Canadian prairie which can become very dry. Calgary has experienced multiple grass fires, such as those on Nose Hill, and some communities in Calgary adjacent to urban forests and grassland areas have an elevated risk from wildfires.Wildfires upstream along the Elbow and Bow Rivers could also impact drinking water supply and quality for years after a fire due to wildfire’s tendency to destroy natural features that assist in protecting water sources from runoff contamination (chemicals, erosion and turbidity).

In addition to the impact on local agriculture, droughts affect the health of plants, wildlife, wetlands, forests, parks, open spaces, recreational facilities and private yards. Drying out of forests increases the risk of wildfires, which impact both local air quality and even water quality if they occur upstream of the source of Calgary’s water supply. Trees and plants also become more susceptible to pest and disease outbreaks (e.g. pine beetles) since lack of water can stress trees, limiting their ability to react to these attacks.Alberta has a large farming and ranching community, and multi-year droughts could impact income of these families, and possibly lead to migration of rural people to the cities.

Heavy rainfall causes significant and costly damage to building foundations, drainage systems and personal property, erosion and compromised slope stability, and potential loss of power. Lightning would damage buildings and supporting infrastructure. Streets and pathways would become unsafe or impassable, trees would be damaged, powerlines downed, and localized flooding would occur due to storm drains being blocked by debris. Calgary is currently the hail capital of Canada.  Hail would have similar consequences plus more damage to personal property primarily vehicles, building envelopes and items stored outdoors. These storms can also cause blockage in drainage systems, causing localized flooding. Calgary and southern Alberta are also already impacted by severe lightning and thunderstorms each year and more frequent storms increases the risk of more frequent hail/lightning/thunderstorms.  The Insurance Bureau of Canada indicates that insurance premiums for homes and cars are increasing due to extreme weather.

These events all increase river and water table levels, leading to overland or groundwater flooding. Although these floods can last only a few days, the flood impacts on people and communities can remain for months to years. Some of the more significant impacts of floods include injuries and the risk of fatalities, power outages, dislocation of residents from their homes and communities, service disruptions, stormwater backups and basement flooding, costly damage to buildings and infrastructure, and long-term changes to rivers including erosion and reduced river bank stability.  The City of Calgary has been addressing the risk of river flooding since the major flood of 2013, through mitigation actions such as river bank engineering, riparian restoration, redesign of storm-water outfalls, construction of berms, and flood gates in high-risk areas.

Outdoor workers and those who enjoy outdoor activities will be most at risk. Growth of invasive species, such as the pine beetle, can wipe out entire forests, with potential impacts to the food chain and local wildlife, as well as negative impacts on forestry and tourism.  Pine beetle killed trees can lead to extreme risk of forest fires, which have affected Alberta and BC communities already.

Populations would also be impacted by stranding or displacement compromised living or working conditions, exposed landfill material in public spaces, and psychological effects. Wind gusts would damage building envelopes as well as mobilize debris, trees and construction site materials. Loss of urban tree canopy would be widespread, recreation and historical sites would be damaged, and water bodies would see increased sediment load from dust and deposition.  City infrastructure may be damaged including bus shelters, signals, street signs, street and lamps. Critical infrastructure would experience interruptions, possibly outages. Tall buildings may see damage to foundations and structure. Damaged or compromised streets and pathways would cause congestion, parks, open spaces and trails would be temporarily closed or restricted, special events would be cancelled, and access to community programs would be reduced or lost.

Longer-term impacts could include the temporary displacement of people from their homes, injuries and deaths, loss of business revenue, and ongoing psychological trauma. Given the extreme difficulty in upgrading infrastructure to survive a tornado impact, improvements to weather monitoring and advance public warning systems are critical. Based on the available scientific data, it is not yet clear to what extent climate change could increase the frequency or severity of tornadoes in Alberta.

In Baltimore’s past, between the 1950s and the 1970s, an average of 60 percent of summer days had met the maximum temperature extremes. In the 2000s, that percentage grew to approximately 75-90 percent of summer days reaching maximum temperature extremes. Studies predict that Baltimore may experience between 85-95 percent such days before the middle of the century, or between 90-95 percent by 2100.The summer season in Baltimore City is known to have frequent high temperatures accompanied by high humidity. On some summer days, urban air can reach temperatures up to 10°F warmer than surrounding suburban or rural areas — a phenomenon known as the “urban heat island effect.” Densely developed, metropolitan areas tend to replace the natural land cover with asphalt, sidewalks, buildings, and other hard infrastructure. As opposed to natural elements of an ecosystem, which can absorb the sun’s heat and cool the surrounding air through evapotranspiration, these hard materials retain and radiate heat. The resulting warm urban temperatures can give rise to adverse public and environmental health problems and can increase energy usage for summertime cooling. The urban heat island effect is anticipated to become intensified as extreme heat events increase as a result of climate change.A significant increase in the number of extreme heat days could place people at a greater risk of suffering from heat-related health conditions, including heat stress, heat exhaustion, or heat stroke. These medical problems are a particular threat to the elderly population, young children, or people with respiratory difficulties. For instance, in the heatwave following the June 29, 2012 derecho, a total of 8 heat-related fatalities were reported in Baltimore City.(excerpt from DP3)

Three categories of food are common in the State of Maryland: flash, riverine, and coastal. In Baltimore, major flooding events are the result of riverine flooding along the stream tributaries of the Patapsco River — including the Gwynns Falls and the Jones Falls, as well as their own tributaries — or from tidal flooding in the Northwest Harbor and Middle Branch of the Patapsco River. Most of Baltimore’s recorded foods have been the result of either flash flooding during sudden, short-lived rainstorms, or localized flooding due to poor drainage and stormwater management.  Baltimore has experienced 72 flood events in the period from 1996 through 2017, seeing an average of 3.27 events annually. In Baltimore, 6.4 percent of the City's total area is currently designated as a high-risk flood zone while 3 percent is within the coastal floodplain.  More frequent and extreme precipitation events could make these conditions a common hazard, and the impacts from sea-level rise and land subsidence will likely intensify future losses.(Excerpt from DP3)

As an additional concern, flood maps indicate that some areas of tidal flooding are also affected by high-velocity flooding. High-velocity flooding, where floodwaters can move faster than five feet per second, can exacerbate flood damage. Tropical storms and hurricanes are very intense, low-pressure wind systems that form over tropical or subtropical waters and can cause coastal flooding.  Baltimore has experienced 13 coastal hazard events from 1997 to2017.  These events are likely to be more frequent and intense in the future.(Excerpt from DP3)

According to the National Climate Assessment, regional climate model simulations suggest that Maryland could experience more than twice as many days per year over 95°F by mid-century — with an estimated 15 additional days above 95°F each year. This is expected to severely impact vulnerable populations, infrastructure, agriculture and ecosystems. In the future, Baltimore expects that periods of extreme heat are likely to increase in frequency, duration, and intensity.(Excerpt from DP3)

Thunderstorms can occur at any time of day and in all months of the year but are most common during summer afternoons or evenings and in combination with frontal boundaries. Maryland experiences approximately 20-40 thunderstorm days per year and frequently occur in Baltimore. Thunderstorms are considered a significant hazard due to their ability to spawn tornadoes, hailstorms, strong winds, fash foods, and damaging lightning.Every thunderstorm is accompanied by lightning; in fact, the actual sound of thunder is a direct result of lightning. The phenomenon occurs when water droplets are carried by the updraft of a thunderstorm to the upper parts of the atmosphere where they freeze and become charged. Lightning is the charged electrical channel that shoots downward toward the earth’s surface. As this channel nears the ground, it is attracted to oppositely-charged channels which, once connected, create a powerful electrical current that produces a visible flash of lightning. Lightning often strikes outside of areas where rain is actually falling, at times appearing as far as 10 miles away from rainfall. It can strike from any part of the storm, and may even strike after the storm has seemed to pass. Additionally, a lightning bolt can warm the surrounding air to temperatures as high as 60,000° Fahrenheit. In Baltimore, lightning strikes have been the cause of significant property damage throughout the years, and have even taken the lives of City residents. As the frequency and intensity of thunderstorms increases, so will the lightning associated with these storms. (Excerpt from DP3)

Both tropical storms and hurricanes are considered tropical cyclones; the distinction, however, is based on wind speeds and, typically, on the amount of destruction produced (i.e. the “impact”). Tropical storms are given a name when the maximum sustained wind speeds within the storm’s eyewall reach or exceed 39 mph. If a tropical storm continues to grow in strength, and peak wind speeds reach 74 mph, it is then declared a hurricane. Coastal storm systems can persist for extended periods of time, and across great distances. As hurricanes are sometimes hundreds of miles across, their effects can be felt in areas that may be quite distant from the storm’s center. Due to a combination of geographic and climatic factors, major hurricanes of Categories 3 and above generally begin to weaken upon reaching the mid-Atlantic.  Recent hurricanes and tropical storm impacts to Baltimore have included minor flooding from heavy rainfall and winds.  Eight storm events related to hurricanes have affected Baltimore from 2013 to 2017.  Hurricane impacts in our area are expected to maintain current frequency but increase in intensity.(Excerpt from DP3)

As a result, a dome of water rises under the eye of the storm and is eventually pushed onto the coastline as the storm makes landfall. The height of a surge is measured as the deviation (in feet) above the average sea level. In extreme circumstances, storm surge can and has exceeded a height of 25 feet in other areas around the world. Storm surge is especially damaging due to the combination of a high volume of water covering a large geographic area that is moving toward or across the land at high velocity. According to NOAA, 9 out of every 10 deaths associated with coastal storms are caused by storm surge—demonstrating why this water phenomenon is often the greatest threat to life and property from a tropical system. As the scale demonstrates, when a storm grows more intense, the resulting storm surge is more likely to reach greater heights and bring more significant damage. Storm surge may also accompany significant coastal storms that are known along the east coast as “Nor’easters.”  Baltimore experienced 13 storm surge/tide and coastal flood events in the period from 1999 to 2017.  The combined anticipated sea-level rise, land subsidence, and potential for tropical systems to cause tidal flooding will likely increase the intensity of storm surge events.(Excerpt from DP3)

Wind poses a threat to Maryland in many forms, including winds that are produced by severe thunderstorms and tropical weather systems. The effects of wind can include blowing debris, interruptions in elevated power and communications utilities, and intensified effects of winter weather. Harm to people and animals, as well as damage to property, trees, and infrastructure, may result.  Data records indicate 156 high wind events took place between 1956 and 2017.  Severe wind events are expected to increase in frequency and intensity.

Winter weather can take many forms, including freezing rain, sleet, extreme cold, and high winds. These conditions may occur singly or in any combination. Freezing rain is that which falls onto a surface where the temperature is below freezing, causing the rain to form a coating of ice. Conversely, sleet occurs as raindrops freeze into ice pellets in the cold air before reaching the ground. Like snow, freezing rain and sleet can create hazardous conditions for motorists. Even small accumulations of ice can make walking or driving extremely dangerous. Moreover, significant accumulations of ice can fell trees and utility lines, resulting in loss of power and communication. While winter storms are expected in Baltimore— and the City budgets and prepares for snow removal activities each year — winter storms occasionally reach a magnitude that overwhelms local response efforts. This stress may be placed on the transportation system as roads are unable to be efficiently salted or plowed, or it may be placed on electrical infrastructure.  Over the past decade, Baltimore City has experienced several strong winter storms that have disrupted regular activities and caused a number of automobile accidents and power outages.  While rising temperatures are causing Baltimore to experience less snowfall overall, we expect to see an increase in intensity from heavy snow events.(Excerpt from DP3)

In a changing climate, increases in average temperature, precipitation, and humidity will enable disease-carrying vectors and pathogens to infiltrate urban environments more easily. These conditions create favorable environments, for example, for breeding mosquitoes, which are known carriers of disease. Already, Baltimore has experienced a growing population of the tiger mosquito, originally native to Southeast Asia. According to the National Climate Assessment, shorter and warmer winters may increase survival and growth of disease-causing agents and parasites. Additionally, a changing climate may influence the distribution of diseases that are sensitive to temperature and moisture — including anthrax, blackleg, and hemorrhagic septicemia — and lead to increased incidence of ketosis, mastitis, and lameness in dairy cows.(Excerpt from DP3)

By the end of the century the average annual temperature in Cincinnati is expected to rise seven degrees and include two major heat waves per year. Our summers will start to feel more like Pharr, TX, a border city 1,400 miles south of Cincinnati! Right now, Ohio averages five days per year that are considered dangerously hot (Over 95°F). That’s two more sweltering days than we saw in 1950, but by 2050 we can expect over 30 dangerously hot days per year. More dangerous heat days mean higher rates of asthma, heat rash and cramps, as well as heat stroke, which can be fatal. Increased heat will affect more than your summer plans. Hotter weather means higher evaporation rates. Rivers like the Great Miami could shrink by 35% , and agricultural productivity will suffer. Winters will be warmer too. With changes to the freeze/thaw cycle comes some unexpected challenges like flooding, increased insect and weed populations, and loss of native species that require cold weather.

Major storm events can cause major damage, ranging from sewer backups, to landslides, to flash flooding. The storms of 2017 have forced the City to spend over $50 million on storm-related issues. These costs have prompted the City to form an Extreme Weather Task Force to evaluate policy recommendations to prepare for and minimize future storm damages. Major flash flooding in May 2020 caused 4,900 Hamilton County residents to lose power and forced evacuations across Southwest Ohio.

While potentially good for farmers and food production, it also impacts insects and agricultural pests. As CO2 levels increase, the nitrogen levels of plants fall—a crucial nutrient for most insects. This can cause pest attacks to be more severe as they eat more plants to gain more nitrogen. And with shorter winters, more of these agricultural nuisances will live longer. Extended periods of hotter weather could mean more ticks and mosquitos in Ohio, and therefore more global spread of infectious diseases and local spread of vector-borne diseases like Lyme. Cincinnati already ranks 25th among the 50 U.S. cities with the most mosquitoes. Some fungi and other pathogens are moving northward up to 4 miles per year. As Cincinnati heats up, the city will have to prepare for bigger populations of familiar and newly introduced pests.

Air quality deteriorates as hotter weather causes more pollutants—ozone and fine particles—which exacerbates respiratory conditions like asthma and chronic obtrusive pulmonary disease. As air pollution increases, so do negative cardiovascular outcomes like heart attacks and deep vein clots. As extreme temperatures become the new normal, Cincinnati could see heat-related deaths increase by 70-120% by the 2080’s. Additionally, the rise of heavy downpours and floods due to climate change will lead to more sewer overflows and wet basements. These events can cause mold to grow in homes and businesses, and transport disease-causing bacteria, viruses, and parasites.

Increasing	Increasing	High	Medium-term (2026-2050)	One of the chronic threats to agriculture from climate change in the Greater Cincinnati Area is crop loss. Rise in average temperatures will lead to longer frost-free seasons and other conditions that can increase crop yield (such as higher concentrations of atmospheric CO2), but this heat will also lead to severe drought and pest issues. Across the state of Ohio, summer drought severity is projected to increase by 50% by 2050.  Lower, more erratic water levels and rising temperatures will cause inland Greater Cincinnati counties such as Butler and Warren to experience the worst droughts in the area.  Hotter summers will create more high-risk working conditions for farmers, and cause crop ranges to migrate north (particularly for corn and soy, resulting in major economic output losses). Wetter springs, more flooding, and effects to quality of agricultural water resources will create more production unpredictability and lead to crop losses if farms are not prepared for severe events.

The city and surrounding area has one of the highest per-capita costs due to landslides in the U.S., especially since 2011.The city is especially susceptible to landslides along streams and valleys, because these areas have primarily silt and clay soils that result in bedrock failure. These failures primarily occur in areas dominated by shale, such as the Kope Formation and the Miamitown Shale. Hazard risk also increases in areas of development, where the land is disturbed due to construction and other activities. Landslides in recent years have increased due to increased rainfall and the hilly nature of the city. Columbia Parkway has been subject to multiple landslides in the last several years alone, which have resulted in road closures and structural damage costing millions of dollars. As landslides become more common, Cincinnati will continue to see damage to infrastructure and housing in residential areas, which increases risks to citizens and harms the strength of our economy.

Cut-off low systems can bring particularly damaging winds and heavy rains. Storm events due to mid-latitude cyclones are projected to decrease into the future due to the southward shift of these weather systems. However, flooding in Cape Town is primarily driven by high vulnerability due to poor drainage, high water tables, the presence of wetlands, and informality and sub-standard housing. This is expected to remain into the future and worsen as increasingly marginal land is informally occupied.

People are likely to be increasingly prone to the negative health effects of increased average and maximum temperatures, including higher mortality rates for elderly and chronically ill people. Higher temperatures could have effects on worker productivity, with knock on economic impacts. Heat stress on crop yields, rangeland and livestock productivity, can cause damage to agricultural productivity, which will affect Cape Town’s food production and supplies. This could increase the price of food and exacerbate food insecurity, particularly for Cape Town’s most vulnerable communities. Heat often leads to an increase in water demand for e.g. watering gardens, filling swimming pools, with serious consequences should heat waves and drought co-occur.

The impacts of this multi-year severe drought led in early 2018 to the unprecedented possibility that Cape Town and surrounds may run out water entirely. This was averted due to strong action taken by the City and citizens of Cape Town to conserve water. The potential impact of severe water shortages included the potential collapse of the city's wastewater and sanitation system due to a lack of water in the system, and the consequent health impacts thereof. The risk to human health through reduced capacity to carry out normal hygiene such as toilet flushing, bathing, and clothes washing also poses a risk to individual and public health. The impacts of drought on agriculture are  serious, with consequent serious negative economic impacts.  In the longer term, water scarcity could have negative effects on: Existing business processes, retention of existing businesses and future new investments, with associated impacts on job retention, job creation and economic growth; The quality of water and the state of rivers and wetland ecosystems, with less water available to flush these systems and with an increased potential for failure of City infrastructure, such as waste water treatment works, which rely on rainfall to dilute treated effluent, all leading to increased human health risks; Biodiversity, where flora and fauna might not survive and drying out of vegetation, which together with increased wind speeds could increase the frequency of wild fires; Water price increases, which could have a knock on effect to the economy and society

Cape Town does not contain significant forest ecosystems. Increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires could have a detrimental effect on lives, biodiversity, infrastructure, agriculture, and insurance. Homes and businesses close to natural areas and nature reserves are most at risk. High winds combined with hot and dry conditions created increased risk of wildfires. New wildfire management procedures are in place which have improved management of this risk. It must be noted that the natural vegetation of Cape Town (fynbos ecosystem) is fire prone and requires fire in order to flourish; it is therefore an ongoing challenge to ensure that natural vegetation is able to burn as required without impacting on human life or health. As such,  controlled ecological burns are conducted in the city's nature reserves where possible. Too-frequent fires will have a negative impact on biodiversity in the city, as many fynbos species are slow growing.

Damage to power lines can cause isolated areas of the city to be without electricity for days, depending on the severity of the damage. Stronger winds will have an impact on certain economic sectors, as this will affect the harbour, which is already not able to operate for a number of days a year due to high wind speeds. Increased wind in combination with drying and increased temperatures will significantly increase the risk and spread of wildfires and urban fires. This is of particular concern within the city's informal settlements, which are already prone to fire. A correlation between the summer season and informal settlement fires has been noted. It is likely that weather conditions which promote the spread of fire contribute to the severity of informal settlement fires.

Average temperatures in Cleveland are projected to increase 3.0°F by mid-century and 5.0°F by the end of century. These higher temperatures will increase the number of heat-related deaths, reduce water quality in Lake Erie, strain food systems, degrade air quality, and put pressure on native plants and animals. Warmer temperatures will reduce building heating loads, but these gains are more than offset by increased reliance on air-conditioning. Increasing intensity of heat waves also increases the chances of another blackout in Northeast Ohio.

An increase in precipitation was observed in all four seasons, with the winter seeing the greatest percentage increase of 23.4% (1.7”). Moreover, the frequency and intensity of severe storms has increased. Cleveland has seen a 16.3% increase in the number of heavy precipitation events (49 storms from 1961 to 1990 compared to 57 storms from 1981 to 2010). The northeastern part of Ohio is projected to experience on the order of 2 more days of heavy precipitation (events greater than 1.25”) per year. Heavy precipitation events of more than 2” in a day (i.e., 24-hour period) are projected to increase by no more than one day (0.25 to 1 days) by mid-century and increase by slightly more (0.75 to 1.25 days) by end of century. Heavy rain and lake effect snow are expected to increase. This may cause flooding, combined sewer overflows, a reduction in river and stream quality, and higher maintenance costs.

This trend means more flooding, which will exacerbate a range of risks to Lake Erie, including harmful algal blooms, an increased number of combined sewer overflows, and declining beach health. Homes in Northeast Ohio will also experience increased rates of flooding.Due to consistent heavy precipitation over the previous year, water levels in Lake Erie and Cuyahoga River experienced record highs in June 2019. This is already having serious impacts on the fishing industry, water-related tourism, recreation, development, and more.

Droughts are historically common and can be severe.  Water resources are critical for the health and prosperity of the City.  As droughts become more frequent and more severe, the City must adapt and change to deal with the conditions.  The City operates under a continuing Drought Contingency Plan, along with Long Range Water Supply Plan, and Water Conservation Plan to help mitigate extreme impacts.

Flooding causes property damage in low-lying areas prone to flooding, and increasingly in areas not previously identified as being floodprone.  Severe flooding and flash flooding can result in mortality.  Climate change will result in increased intensity and frequency of high-intensity rainfall events that can cause flooding.  Dallas has invested in improvements to levees/ pumping systems and some local drainage systems to reduce the impacts of flooding; however, the City is now working to address the older local neighbourhood drainage systems that remain vulnerable.

Along the Trinity River system upstream of Dallas, there are four large reservoirs used for water supply and flood control. In 2015, the region received the annual average rainfall within the period of one month, causing this upstream flood storage capacity to be simultaneously exceeded at all four reservoirs.  This resulted in both localized flooding near the reservoirs, and uncontrolled discharge and flooding within the Trinity River floodway for an extended period.  Dallas has an extensive levee system that protects a majority of the City population, and the central business district from this type of flooding.  However, the outlying areas not protected by levees, and areas served by aging infrastructure remain vulnerable to riverine flood threat.

A maior parte da população com maior vulnerabilidade às mudanças de temperatura está localizada no setor oeste da cidade, onde as condições de precariedade socioeconômica também são marcantes. Principais impactos:   Desenvolvimento da cidade - o aumento da temperatura poderá causar o aumento no númerode casos de doenças respiratórias, bem como desidratação e insolação uma vez que a temperatura média já é elevada durante todo o ano. Todos estes impactos à saúde poderão repercutir em gastos no sistema de atendimento público à saúde, assim como também poderá impactar o setor privado por conta do absenteísmo. Também é importante mencionar o risco quanto a elevação do consumo de energia com o uso de condicionadores de ar e de água. Todos estes fatores em conjunto possuem um considerável potencial de impactar o desenvolvimento da cidade de Fortaleza.  Infraestrutura - com o aumento da temperatura, possivelmente ocorrerão impactos principalmente nas infraestruturas de abastecimento de água e energia elétrica, no sentido de ficarem sobrecarregados com a demanda. Saúde - conforme já mencionado é possível que haja um aumento da demanda por atendimento nas unidades de saúde por conta de doenças respiratórias, mal-estar súbito e quadros de insolação de modo geral. A biodiversidade também sofrerá impactos e desequilíbrios que poderão culminar com a proliferação de determinados vetores (mosquitos e insetos). Recursos hídricos e disponibilidade de água - No que se refere ao aumento da temperatura deforma mais ampla, deve ser mencionado o possível impacto no abastecimento de água, rede que conta com mananciais de uma região interior do Estado do Ceará. Uma vez que as temperaturas aumentem, este abastecimento poderá ser prejudicado, ou mesmo interrompido, tendo como motivo o agravamento dos quadros de secas em todo o Estado do Ceará e maior consumo de água. Unidades de conservação/Áreas preservadas - As áreas verdes da cidade, embora possuam espécies adaptadas ao contexto climático do semiárido, também poderão ser impactadas pelo aumento da temperatura média sendo um dos principais riscos associados aos desequilíbrios ambientais causados pelo desaparecimento (por migração) de espécies mais sensíveis ao calor.

Portanto, é evidenciada uma alta e uma média vulnerabilidade concentrada nos setores com recursos hídricos e áreas verdes que são afetados de maneira forte pelas secas. Também os setores com uma alta densidade demográfica representam um risco climático.- Desenvolvimento da cidade: ainda que haja um certo nível de garantia quanto ao abastecimento de água para Fortaleza, toda a cidade depende da produção de alguns alimentos realizada em outros municípios do Ceará. Além disso, não se pode afirmar que exista segurança hídrica em Fortaleza, sobretudo nos casos de secas prolongadas e isso tem potencial para afetar todo o setor produtivo da cidade, bem como a qualidade de vida da população.— Infraestrutura: o principal risco verificado quanto às infraestruturas diz respeito ao setor de abastecimento de água e energia, os quais poderão sofrer sobrecarga, bem como o setor de transportes e moradia caso haja migração de outros municípios para Fortaleza.— Saúde: semelhante aos impactos estimados para o risco de aumento da temperatura, porém com o agravo da desidratação e desnutrição da população de maior vulnerabilidade. Adicionalmente a seca aumenta o risco de enfermidades, especialmente em setores de alta vulnerabilidade da população.— Recursos hídricos e disponibilidade de água: no caso de secas prolongadas, corre-se o risco de colapso no abastecimento de água.— Unidades de conservação/Áreas preservadas: Embora possuam espécies adaptadas ao contexto climático do semiárido, as áreas verdes também sofrerão impactos das secas prolongadas. Neste caso não apenas pela migração de espécies mais sensíveis à estiagem, mas também pela possibilidade de substituição destas áreas por agricultura urbana diante de um quadro de desabastecimento alimentar. Vale ressaltar também que rios e lagoas urbanos estariam ameaçados pela retirada de água para consumo humano, caso o abastecimento via rede regular chegue a um colapso.

Com a ampliação do risco de chuvas intensas e chuvas extremas, haverá impactos diretos para o desenvolvimento da cidade, tanto no aspecto da fluidez de pessoas para seus trabalhos e centros de educação, quanto pelo aporte de recursos financeiros necessários para obras e reparos necessários para adaptar a cidade a um novo contexto climático.— Infraestrutura: o principal risco verificado quanto às infraestruturas diz respeito às galerias de drenagem de águas pluviais e também as de esgotamento sanitário. Assim como as pavimentações e recapeamentos necessários para adaptação ao um novo cenário chuvoso.— Saúde: as doenças hidricamente veiculadas cujos vetores se proliferam por meio das águas não drenadas em determinadas áreas urbanas.Sobre isso merece destaque o fato de que Fortaleza possui apenas uma pequena parte de seu território com cobertura de esgotamento sanitário, o que permite inferir que em períodos muito chuvosos, existe uma tendência de que as águas pluviais se misturam com os efluentes sanitários e escoem livremente pelas ruas, além de se infiltrarem no solo por todo o território, inclusive onde já existe rede regular de esgotamento sanitário.— Recursos hídricos e disponibilidade de água: caso houvesse em Fortaleza a obrigatoriedade de captação de água das chuvas e reuso nas empresas e condomínios, o aumento das chuvas poderia ter um impacto positivo quanto ao abastecimento. Contudo, no contexto atual o que se verifica é um risco de contaminação das fontes de abastecimento— Unidades de conservação/Áreas preservadas: no caso de ampliação dos períodos chuvosos e intensidade das chuvas uma vez que os ambientes são adaptados às condições atuais com poucas chuvas durante o ano. Além da morte de algumas espécies vegetais por saturação hídrica, ainda existe o risco de que espécies invasoras e mais adaptadas a ambientes brejosos ou alagados passem a ocupar estes espaços, exigindo uma adaptação em todo o ecossistema diretamente associado.

Na zona costeira de Fortaleza, foram identificados 162 eventos denominados “ressacas do mar”, sendo que 95% destes eventos foram registrados a partir da década de 1980, momento em que há uma maior urbanização do litoral Fortalezense.  Dentre os impactos das inundações costeiras pode-se citar: erosão de dunas e praias; danos a estrutura urbana; e potencial de alagamento.  Além de:— Desenvolvimento da cidade: considerando que são nos bairros com interface para o mar (Aldeota, Meireles, Centro, dentre outros) onde estão atualmente situadas as maiores ofertas de empregos e também onde estão localizados os bancos e demais instituições ligadas ao mercado financeiro, pode-se inferir um impacto direto para o desenvolvimento da cidade. Além disso, boa parte da economia da cidade depende dos serviços relacionados ao turismo (hotelaria, entretenimento e gastronomia) cuja localização também está à beira mar. — Infraestrutura: o principal risco verificado quanto às infraestruturas diz respeito à destruição das infraestruturas urbanas localizadas à beira mar, bem como à emersão dos esgotos também nos bairros situados na faixa litorânea por conta da intrusão marinha, que é a invasão da água do mar por vias subterrâneas.— Saúde: os impactos relacionados à saúde humana estão diretamente relacionais à emersão dos efluentes para a superfície, o carreamento de resíduos sólidos para o interior da cidade e à salinização das fontes de abastecimento, tanto dos poços, quanto da rede regular de abastecimento.— Recursos hídricos e disponibilidade de água: o principal impacto da elevação do nível do mar ao sistema de abastecimento se dá pela salinização generalizada por conta do avanço da cunha salina.— Unidades de conservação/Áreas preservadas: com a elevação do nível do mar, boa parte das áreas protegidas hoje em Fortaleza, representadas por vegetação de mangue e localizadas próximas à foz dos rios seriam completamente dizimadas. Além disso, haveria uma tendência ao estabelecimento de espécies invasoras, tanto da flora quanto da fauna.

This will in turn affect residential areas and communities that rely on the available tap water. The entire Miami society may not only face potable water issues, but also public health issues and impacts on local agriculture/food production. Current development standards that do not prioritize permeability as well as Everglades drainage canals (built in the 1950s) limit aquifer recharge.Miami-Dade County’s primary source of potable water is the Biscayne Aquifer which is vulnerable to salt water intrusion.  With increasing water demands, a growing population and the effects of sea level rise, water conservation is crucial to preserve the aquifer and make it more resilient to these pressures.  Given that water and sewer are managed at the County and Regional level by the Miami Dade County Water and Sewer District and South Florida Water Management District, the City’s role is to serve as a strong partner in their initiatives to maintain the quality and quantity of our surface water, groundwater and drinking water. This includes, for example, enforcement of regulation of land uses and activities that may contribute to pollution, monitoring, soil and water remediation, stormwater management, and natural resource restoration and co-hosting education workshops for homeowners and businesses on energy and water efficiency and conservation.  Miami-Dade County’s report on its efforts to monitor and control saltwater intrusion is here.  https://www.miamidade.gov/green/library/sea-level-rise-flooding-saltwater-intrusion.pdf

As a waterfront city, Miami has an average elevation of just 6 FT above sea level, however recent studies predict a storm surge as high as 13.4 FT above sea level during a 1% storm event coupled with sea level rise predictions. With Miami's low elevation, Storm surge will have an extensive reach throughout much of the city. 60% of the City's seawall is owned by residents (private property) so the City cannot perform uniform upgrades. Waterfront property owners range in socioeconomic status, those along the Miami River are most vulnerable. Storm surge was between 3-6 feet during Hurricane Irma in 2017.  The US Army Corps of Engineers in completing a Coastal Storm Risk Management Study which will recommend measures to reduce the probability and storm surge damages from occurring and mitigate the consequences when storm surge events occur.

The speed of rise has accelerated over the last ten years and it’s now rising by 0.22 inch each year. According to Unified Sea Level Rise Projections, sea level is projected to rise 10 to 17 inches above 1992 mean sea level by 2040 and by 2070, it is projected to rise 21 to 40 inches (above 1992 mean sea level). Miami is seen as the tip of the spear when it comes to sea level rise impacts and is an existential threat for many. Miami's struggles with SLR are unique due to porous limestone bedrock, making holistic and integrated solutions a necessity. Major stormwater management and drainage infrastructure improvements are needed to address this challenge, which has a high price tag. It is important for Miami's economy to remain strong so municipalities have access to financial resources and expertise. Sea Level Rise impacts the future of development and land use in South Florida. As time goes on and SLR impacts become more pronounced, some areas of the City may need to retreat if infrastructure solutions are not sufficient.

With increased heat, humidity, and rainfall, Miami will remain a hospitable environment for vectors, like mosquitoes, and therefore the diseases they carry.Most recently, Miami dealt with the Zika virus outbreak in 2016. One of Miami's most popular commercial and tourist destinations, Wynwood, was deemed a Zika transmission area and economic activity came to an abrupt halt. Miami had to deploy workers to canvas neighborhoods to eliminate standing water threats. Miami worked together with surrounding municipalities to tackle the threat and this inter-jurisdictional response will be necessary to combat future disease pandemics.

As global average temperature continues to rise due to climate change, hurricane intensity and rainfall are projected to increase. Over time, Miamians may see increased frequency/instances of Category 4 and 5 storms. Rising sea levels will lead to more storm surge, warmer air will lead to more rainfall, and a warmer ocean will lead to faster wind speed – all of which can make hurricanes more powerful. Due to storms, many will be forced to evacuate/relocate and there will be an increase in demand of public services and resources - especially from LMI populations. These severe storms can cause major property damage to individual residents and the city. Hurricane Irma (2017) was the 5th costliest hurricane in U.S. history costing $50 billion to recover from. Hurricane Irma’s storm surge was between 3 and 6 feet in Miami.

By 2050 that could increase to over 100 days per year. Extreme heat and humidity is particularly dangerous for youth, elder adults, low-income individuals, and outdoor workers. A hotter, wetter climate will continue to increase the length of mosquito season which can make residents more susceptible to vector-borne diseases like Zika virus.Many low income residents do not have or have limited access to air conditioning which is a public health threat. In the case of a blackout, lack of AC especially in assisted living facilities could be deadly which is why ALFs are required to have generators (compliance rate is currently not 100%).

King Tides are higher-than-normal tidal floods which occur annually and predictably in September through November in Miami. Heavy rainfall coupled with high tides can overwhelm current storm water infrastructure and prevent proper drainage. Miami currently sees flooding from King Tides but at a very low level - King Tide flooding has only impacted daily life when coupled with a rain event (like in 2017). Groundwater flooding is a major problem for those with septic systems as it can cause them to overflow.Septic systems treat wastewater from individual properties. The wastewater from kitchens, bathrooms, and other sources is partially treated as the wastewater flows through a septic tank and subsequently a drainfield, where the clarified liquid is further treated by the unsaturated soil. Thus, by design, the drainfield must be above the groundwater table and remain unsaturated to function effectively. Consequently, septic systems are highly vulnerable to rising groundwater levels. In fact, rising sea levels are already affecting septic systems in certain areas and these impacts are expected to increase over time.Observed King Tide flooding in October 2017: https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/editmid=1KWSSg7rOkqaSr0ealyCsr_uQ68I&ll=25.50121948053221%2C-80.93102899999997&z=9

Contudo, essa situação tende a piorar, segundo um levantamento feito pelo Governo do Estado de Pernambuco. Tal pesquisa avaliou o percentual do número máximo de dias secos consecutivos ao ano, chamado de índice CDD, que representa um parâmetro climático que indica a possibilidade de estiagens. Quanto mais alto o índice, mais afetado será o município. Desta forma, o índice CDD do Recife é de 53%, o que corresponde ao terceiro município pernambucano mais impactado pela ocorrência de estiagens no Estado a partir de 2041.  Os efeitos dessa nova configuração climática para a cidade serão posteriormente mensurados. Contudo, estudos indicam que longos períodos de estiagem aumenta o risco de erosão, diminui o fluxo de rios, o que afeta diretamente as atividades pesqueiras e os ecossistema ribeirinhos ao diminuir o aporte de água doce nos ecossistemas estuarinos, sendo estes bastante característicos da cidade. Além disso, eventos de estiagem também deterioram a qualidade da água, ao diminuir sua capacidade de diluição, e baixa sua disponibilidade para o consumo doméstico, impactando negativamente as condições de saúde e higiene da população. O Recife possui 3 bacias hidrográficas que ocupam todo o seu território. São elas: Bacia do Capibaribe, do Beberibe e do RioTejipió. Entretanto, a oferta de água da Região Metropolitana do Recife é bastante complexa, sendo composta por uma série de sistemas integrados e de sistemas isolados complementares. Considerando apenas o município do Recife, existe uma combinação da limitaçãoda resolução dos modelos de projeções climáticas regionais, com a própria extensão do município, que é afetado por eventos de precipitação. A ameaça de seca meteorológica considerou a ocorrência de falta ou racionamento de água caso a ameaça se concretize por tempo sufi ciente e, por consequência, como a população poderia lidar com esse impacto, não sendo considerada a gestão ou insipiência na gestão das bacias que atendem a cidade.

Dito isso, estudos indicam que na área costeira da cidade, o nível do mar subiu 5,6 milímetros entre 1946 e 1988, o que significa uma elevação de 24 centímetros em 42 anos. No mesmo período, a erosão costeira e a ocupação do pós-praia provocaram uma redução da linha de praia em mais de 20 metros em Boa Viagem.Complementarmente, um estudo realizado pela NASA indica a vulnerabilidade do Recife perante o degelo de calotas polares, tanto às pertencentes ao polo sul, como também às do polo norte. De acordo com o estudo, quanto mais distante da calota em risco a cidade está localizada, mais chances ela tem de sofrer com os efeitos do degelo e ter seu nível do mar aumentado. Desta forma, Recife é mais fortemente afetada pelo derretimento das calotas polares do norte (Groelândia) e da porção mais à leste da Antártida (mais próxima da Austrália e Nova Zelândia). Sendo assim, o mapeamento realizado por esse estudo identificou que cerca de 30% desse aumento do nível do mar informado no Recife deve-se ao derretimento da Groelândia. A concretização desse cenário afeta não só a infraestrutura costeira densamente habitada da cidade, onde estão concentrados diversos tipos de oferta de bens e serviços, além de alguns dos principais corredores de transporte da cidade, como também a destruição de um dos ecossistemas mais vulneráveis aos efeitos da mudança do clima: os estuários. Devido à proximidade do Recife com os rios e o mar, e ao relevo do litoral pernambucano, o qual apresenta trechos abaixo do nível do mar, a cidade possui ambientes estuarinos bastante característicos. Sendo assim, a zona costeira de Pernambuco apresenta treze estuários. Destes, dois estão localizados no Recife: o estuário do Rio Capibaribe, que inclui a maior reserva de mangue urbano das Américas, e o estuário do Rio Beberibe.  Pequenas alterações no nível médio do mar podem modificar o nível de base dos sistemas fluviais e intensificar o processo de erosão costeira e inundação no Recife. Segundo dados registrados no Porto do Recife para o período de 1946 a 1988, houve uma elevação de 5,6 mm/ano. O diagnóstico aponta um aumento progressivo do nível do mar de aproximadamente 0,01m a cada 5 anos.

Isso ocorre, pois, as galerias aquáticas da cidade desaguam no mar ou no rio. Porém, quando a maré está alta, as águas acabam retornando para as ruas localizadas em um nível mais baixo. Como todos os cenários traçados para a cidade preveem o aumento cada vez mais acentuado do nível do mar em sua zona costeira, as estimativas é que essa situação descrita se espalhe por outros pontos da cidade, afetando ainda mais a infraestrutura urbana e causando mais transtornos para a população.

Ainda de acordo com a pesquisa, existem 206.761 pessoas vivendo em locais expostos aos perigos de eventos naturais extremos, o que correspondia a cerca de 13% do total da população do município. A ocupação nos morros do Recife se caracteriza por construções precárias ao noroeste e sul do município. Dado o relevo da região, toda a parte mais elevada do município está sujeita emalgum grau à ameaça de deslizamento. No cenário projetado de 2011-2040, há um aumento da intensidade da ameaça de deslizamento. Esse risco se concentra apenas nas regiões com relevo naturalmente mais acidentado. O déficit habitacional, e a densidade demográfica em conjunto com as concentrações de população sensível, especialmente nas Comunidades de Interesse Social (CIS),  são as maiores forças na definição das zonas com risco de deslizamento. O processo de ocupação desordenada de encostas cominclinações elevadas apenas acentua a vulnerabilidade da população.

De modo geral, toda cidade está sujeita à ameaça de ondas de calor, porém, essa ameaça diminui conforme se distancia do litoral no sentido do interior e noroeste do município, onde se encontram as áreas com maior concentração de vegetação. Para definir as zonas com riscos mais elevados, consideram-se fatores que intensificam o risco, como a população sensível (crianças e idosos), especialmente nas áreas com menor arborização. Há um aumento da intensidade da ameaça entre a base histórica e o cenário projetado, o que reflete o aumento progressivo das temperaturas projetadas. A ameaça passa a ser ainda mais intensa na região próxima ao litoral e permeando nas regiões mais centrais e no norte do município, resultando no agravamento na concentração de calor e influenciando no bem-estar e na saúde da população. O aumento progressivo da temperatura poderá impactar a saúde da população em virtude do desconforto térmico e piora na qualidade do ar

We are currently faced with flash flooding.  This usually results in landslides, Combined Sewer Overflow, and property (infrastructure) damage.    It leads to public safety issues where roads are not passable to respond to emergencies, sewage is backed up into residential and commercial basements, and greater health issues such as mold leading to respiratory issues, an increase in mosquitos and cholera exposure due to standing/ stagnant water.  In 2011 a flash flood claimed four lives. As rain events become more frequent and more severe, roads that were paved over streams are more prone to flooding which endangers citizens and emergency responders. We are actively combating this issues with major upgrades to our water system to install a two pipe system as well as Green Infrastructure.  Awareness campaigns and flood prevention technologies have also been deployed.

The local energy grid struggles to meet peak load for cooling needs, so an extremely hot day could cause blackouts. Pittsburgh also struggles with Air Quality issues and has some of the highest rates of youth suffering from asthma.  Extreme heat in combination with poor air, with the addition of increased air pollution as a result of the generation and transmission of energy to keep of with demands to supply air conditioning and fans, only further exacerbates those suffering from health issues as a result of poor air quality.

IHistorically, the City of Sacramento has experienced about four extreme heat days per year. By midcentury (2040-2049), the City is projected to experience between 19 and 22 extreme days per year. At the end of the century (2090-2099), this number is anticipated to be between 22 and 62 extreme heat days per year. Heat waves are projected to increase in frequency, intensity, and duration for the Sacramento region. Extreme heat waves are expected to increase in number by ten times in the Sacramento region and could become an annual event by 2100. Sacramento could experience up to 100 additional days per year with temperatures above 95°F and by 2090, the average July temperature could reach over 104°F.

However, thisincrease will not occur at a uniform rate throughout the year. Results of modeling the Sacramento region predict a slight increase in winter rainfall, while spring and summer months.  Historically, the City ofSacramento has experienced about twelve extreme rain events per year. This number couldincrease to about fourteen extreme rain events by the end of the century. The duration ofthese high intensity storms may produce higher volumes of runoff, contribute to increasedflood risk, intensify weatherization of transportation infrastructure such as roads andbridges, and contribute to levee failure.

However, rising sea levels may lead to levee failures in the Delta causing infrastructure damage, flooding, and saltwater intrusion into groundwater aquifers that may affect Sacramento region groundwater sources. It is also possible that sea level rise could reduce the effectiveness of Delta and nearby Delta levees, or increase flood levels in tidally affected reaches of the Sacramento River, if storm flow and tide conditions coincide. An influx of saltwater would degrade California’s inland estuaries, wetlands, and groundwater aquifers. Saltwater intrusion could threaten the quality and reliability of California’s biggest fresh water supply that is pumped from the southern edge of the Sacramento/San Joaquin River Delta.  Areas near the delta are most vulnerable to the effects of sea level rise. Rising sea levels in the Delta may result in saltwater intrusion into the Sacramento River; increased freshwater demands from the municipal and agricultural sector and reduced snowpack may cause further increases in river salinity. In 2014, the U.S.Department of Interior Bureau of Reclamation predicted that Delta salinity may increase by 33% by the end of the century.

By 2100, between six and 10 more heat waves can be expected per year.  Increased temperatures manifested as heat waves and sustained high heat days directly harm human health through heat-related illnesses (mild heat stress to fatal heat stroke) and the exacerbation of pre-existing conditions in the medically fragile, chronically ill, and vulnerable. In 2012, nearly 40% of adult county residents reported one or more chronic health conditions, 15% reported being diagnosed with asthma, and about 19% were obese. Furthermore, nearly 8% of county residents 5 years or older had a mental or physical disability. In 2010, the county had approximately 39,000 outdoor workers whose occupation increased their risk of heat illness, and about 35% of households in the county were estimated to lack air conditioning. Increased heat also intensifies the photochemical reactions that produce smog and ground level ozone and fine particulates (PM2.5), which contribute to and exacerbate respiratory disease in children and adults. Increased heat and carbon dioxide enhance the growth of plants that produce pollen, which are associated with allergies. Increased temperatures add to the heat load of buildings in urban areas and exacerbate existing urban heat islands adding to the risk of high ambient temperatures. In addition, violent crime has been shown to increase during heat events. In 2005-2010, there was an annual average of 99 heat-related emergency room visits in the county, and an age-adjusted rate of 5.7 emergency room visits per 100,000 persons. In addition, habitats in our county have evolved in a relatively mild climate, with few temperature extremes. As a result, the county currently supports several fragile habitats that may be particularly vulnerable to climate extremes, including Serpentine Scrub, Ephemeral Wetlands, and Redwood Forests. However, temperature increases will impact all habitats. Examples of potential impacts include species composition changes and increase in invasive species. Decreases in ecosystem services associated with vegetation change may also result in impacts to adjacent built lands.

Heat waves have been highly variable each year, but night time heat waves have shown a marked increase since the mid-1970s. During periods of extreme heat energy demand increases as more people rely on air conditioning to stay cool. Lack of air conditioning increases risk of illness or death in extreme heat events, which pose the greatest risk to the elderly; people with mental illness, chronic conditions, or low incomes; people who are homeless or incarcerated; and those experiencing social or health-related vulnerabilities. In addition, violent crime has been shown to increase during heat events.

The most recent drought from 2012 to 2016 was the most extreme since instrumental records began. In years to come, annual rainfall is expected to decrease in the Bay Area – 1 to 3 inches by 2050 and 4 to 5 inches by 2090.  Drought, both in the Sierra Nevada mountains and the local region, decreases the availability and quality of water for humans. This includes reduced water levels to fight wildfires. Drought may increase exposure to health hazards including wildfires, dust storms, extreme heat events, land subsidence, increased water pollution, erosion, degraded water quality, reduced water quantity, degradation of watersheds, alteration of ecosystems and loss of habitat. It can also lead to the emergence of new contagious and vector-borne disease. Although San José significantly cut back on its water consumption during the most recent drought, a rebound is expected, and demand will continue to grow in the absence of long-term measures. It is in the community’s interest to curb its water use to reduce the strain on the water supply and be prepared for future droughts. In addition, habitats in our county have evolved in a relatively mild climate, with large storms and long, intense droughts happening only rarely. As a result, the county currently supports several fragile habitats that may be particularly vulnerable to climate extremes, including Serpentine Scrub, Ephemeral Wetlands, and Redwood Forests. However, precipitation changes will impact all habitats. Examples of potential impacts include species composition changes due to more frequent wildfires and increase in invasive species. Decreases in ecosystem services associated with vegetation change may also result in impacts to adjacent built lands.

While flood mitigation features continue to be installed over time, climate change is projected to increase flood volumes by 60 to 80% over the next 50 years. Climate change is also expected to drive earlier snow melt upstream, leading to higher stream flow increases and increased likelihood of flooding. San José’s waterways have a history of flooding causing damage to private property and transportation infrastructure. Most recently in February 2017, the Coyote Creek flooded large areas of downtown San José causing $73 million in damages, including extensive damage in residential neighborhoods.

With an additional 55 inches of sea level rise, the inundation zone would potentially include more than 39,000 residents. The residential community of Alviso, the San Jose-Santa Clara Regional Wastewater Facility (Facility), several solid waste facilities, a water purification facility and numerous other privately-owned industrial sites, including many of Silicon Valley's ""high-tech"" companies, could all be subject to coastal flooding. The area also features extensive wildlife habitat."

In 2010, about 2% of the county’s residents lived in fire hazard zones of moderate to very high severity. From 1980 to 1989, 24 wildfires at least 490 acres in size consumed a total of 112,892 acres in the Bay Area. The CAL FIRE archives (which report only fires of a significant size) include 62 instances of wildfire in the county from 1878 to 2009, affecting 113,345 acres or 177 square miles.  Drought, which is expected to occur more frequently with climate change, increases the risk of wildfires and reduces the amount of water available to fight wildfires. Climate change is also expected to cause fires to spread faster and burn more intensely in most vegetation types, particularly grassland. In Santa Clara County, a 51% increase in future is expected in fires that escape, as well as a 41% increase in the amount of acres burned in the average “contained” fire. In addition, more frequent or extensive fires could drive shifts from forest to grass and shrub vegetation, increasing susceptibility to future fires.  Wildfires impact watersheds by increasing the risk of landslides, mudslides, and sediment in run-off that reduces water quality.  In addition to fire-related injuries, local and regional transport of smoke, ash, and fine particles increases respiratory and cardiovascular risks. Wildfires can also disrupt energy distribution, both directly by disrupting transmission lines and indirectly by causing utilities to shut down electricity distribution to avoid generating fire-starting sparks. In San Jose, PG&E began using Public Safety Power Shutoffs (PSPSs) during the 2019 fire season to reduce the risk of wildfire by preemptively stopping electricity distribution during high-temperature, high-wind conditions. In the first PSPS event affecting San Jose in 2019, almost 20,000 San Jose customer accounts went without power an average of more than 16 hours. In the second PSPS event affecting San Jose, almost 7,500 customer accounts went without power for an average of more than 40 hours. These accounts included hundreds of residents relying on electrically powered medical equipment and critical facilities including fire stations, police stations, lift and pump stations, cooling centers, healthcare facilities, assisted living facilities, public libraries, traffic lights, and schools.

The impacts were on the public health system and relative service costs, on the industrial processes (more fire due to very hot temperatures and difficulties in the water using  for cooling). The heatwaves affect the green of the city,  favoring the invasive plants (algae bloom in the rivers) and insects spread out. The human wellbeing was affected, with general discomfort for the people living in the city, transportation and social activities. The loss of productivity, not yet quantified, is another probable impact. Also energy blackouts can occur during heat waves period due to the high request for cooling. Sometimes ozone pollution is leaded by heat waves.At the moment no impacts were recorded on the fresh drinkable water but, considering the future scenarios, the city have to adopt measures to assure this service avoiding interruptions.We expect that in the future the risks will increase both in terms of frequency and intensity.

Basements are particularly at risk of being flooded. Factors such as inadequate ground levelling and the presence of a garage entrance with a slope toward the house can result in the flooding of homes. Also, unprotected buildings can suffer from sewer backups. Building floods cause considerable economic losses. First, they result in costs related to property destruction and damages. Second, the increase in flood damages to buildings results in increased insurance premiums and can even sometimes reduce insurers’ coverage of this risk. Significant emotional or material losses can bring about psychological distress among victims. Also, flooded buildings are at a greater risk of developing mould, which can cause serious health problems, such as asthma and allergic reactions. Heavy rainwater runoff and floods in urban environments may also damage the road network, sewer systems (particularly retention basins, rainwater and combined sewers and pumping stations) and underground facilities, which can result in service outages depending on the service (electricity, telephone, Internet, and so forth). In addition to reducing people’s mobility in the area, floods have caused accidents and discomforts.Four categories of impacts have been identified, which includes many assets/services selection, but that have not been prioritized in terms of assets/services affected: the built environment, the population, the natural environment and municipal activities. For example, Service des infrastructures, de la voirie et du transport (Infrasctruture road and transport service), Service de la mise en valeur du territoire (land development service) and City of Montréal (19 boroughs) and the 15 related cities are affected.

Extreme heat may even aggravate individuals’ frail condition and cause premature deaths. In the past 30 years, heat waves have been responsible for over 400 deaths in the Montréal agglomeration. Heat waves can also exacerbate the impacts of atmospheric pollution, aggravate health problems and restrict the practice of outdoor activities and sports. Vegetation is also vulnerable to heat waves, because extreme heat induces shocks, such as water stress, that can lead to illnesses; in turn, these problems increase the need for preventive maintenance and treatment. Heat waves, even brief ones, can diminish the populations of many insects. This may be positive in the case of harmful species, but unwanted in the case of species such as pollinators. The aquatic environment may also suffer during heat waves since heat waves give rise to cyanobacteria blooms. Extreme temperatures can affect or weaken the agglomeration’s infrastructures by impacting roads and arteries. Roadways that are heavily travelled and used by heavy vehicles may soften, deform and produce ruts under the weight of these vehicles. Extreme temperatures can also cause premature damages to structures’ expansion joints. Finally, heat waves often give rise to an increased demand for certain services, such as the use of swimming pools, wading pools and splash pads, and the extension of the business hours of airconditioned public buildings such as libraries and community centres.Four categories of impacts have been identified, which includes many assets/services selection, but that have not been prioritized in terms of assets/services affected: the built environment, the population, the natural environment and municipal activities. For example, Service des grands parcs, du verdissement et du Mont Royal (Large Parks, Greening and Mont Royal Service),  Service de la mise en valeur du territoire (Land  Development Service), City of Montréal (19 boroughs) and the 15 related cities are affected.

Droughts in urban settings mainly affect water quality due to a rise in temperature, a decline in dissolved oxygen concentrations, cyanobacteria blooms, eutrophication and an increased concentration of some pollutants. Droughts are also a source of water stress for plants, and may even kill them should the drought be a long one. This stress can also increase trees’ vulnerability to pests and pathogens. Drought periods are often accompanied by extreme heat that affects the level of air pollutants, such as dust and particles, as well as pollen, which is more easily airborne. The increase in airborne pollutants is believed to exacerbate the symptoms of respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses and contribute to degrading the health of people who are already frail. The operational impacts of drought particularly affect drinking water production and distribution networks. The increased demand for water can result in too much pressure on water treatment and purification equipment. Equipment’s adduction ability can also be impaired if water levels are very low, thus restricting the capacity of water production plants. Lastly, when there is limited rainfall, more street cleaning operations are required for streets to remain clean.Four categories of impacts have been identified, which includes many assets/services selection, but that have not been prioritized in terms of assets/services affected: the built environment, the population, the natural environment and municipal activities. For example, Service de l'eau (Water service),  Service de la mise en valeur du territoire (Land  Development Service), City of Montréal (19 boroughs) and the 15 related cities are affected.

In an urban setting, floods result in damages to the built environment and especially to buildings located in floodplains. They also impact sewer systems. In a flood, the sewer systems may saturate more quickly, resulting in backedup sewers in buildings. Heavy floods may weaken overtaxed infrastructures and damage them. Spring floods may also cause damage to underground utilities (electricity, telephone, Internet, and so forth), which can lead to service outages. Also, floods cause premature erosion and destabilization of riverbanks. Eroded riverbanks drag sediment into the water, which may affect water quality. Spring floods also impact the health of the populations affected. Not only can they bring about gastrointestinal illnesses when people are in direct contact with flood waters, they can cause psychological trauma to people who incur major material losses. Moreover, flooded basements are subject to the proliferation of mould, which can result in serious health issues such as asthma and allergic reactions. Floods in an urban environment can make it more difficult to move around, close sections of roadways and slow down traffic. Tunnels and viaducts may be submerged, causing traffic problems and even endangering the lives of people trapped in their vehicles. Lastly, river floods require a major mobilization of the teams responsible for implementing emergency response measures.Four categories of impacts have been identified, which includes many assets/services selection, but that have not been prioritized in terms of assets/services affected: the built environment, the population, the natural environment and municipal activities. For example, 5 boroughs of the City of Montréal (Ahuntsic Cartierville, Îles-Bizard-Sainte-Geneviève, Montréal-Nord, Pierrefonds-Roxboro, Rivières-des-Pariries-Pointe-aux-Trembles) and two related cities (Senneville and Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue) are affected.

Strong wind bursts can tear up or lift off certain elements of a house, for example its roof. Flying debris may hit and damage windows, window displays and façades, in addition to being a hazard for pedestrians. Heavy snowfalls and freezing rain can overload a roof structure and inflict damages. Storm disaster victims may suffer from psychological trauma. Destructive storms may also cause power outages. When outages occur in winter, citizens may have to leave their homes in search of warmth; in the home, they may suffer from carbon monoxide poisoning if they use heating or cooking devices indoors that are designed for outdoor use. Other direct consequences of power outages include the stoppage of home medical equipment and an increase in food poisoning when refrigerators and freezers stop working. The damages inflicted on lights or traffic signs, as well as the snow, ice or debris on the ground, can disrupt road traffic and pedestrian movement. The environmental impacts of destructive storms in an urban milieu mainly affect the vegetation, particularly in terms of uprooting trees or breaking their trunks and branches, which renders them more vulnerable to insects and diseases. Destructive storms increase pressure on service teams providing road maintenance (snow removal and road salting), tree maintenance and first response.Four categories of impacts have been identified, which includes many assets/services selection, but that have not been prioritized in terms of assets/services affected: the built environment, the population, the natural environment and municipal activities. For example, 19 boroughs of the City of Montréal and 15 related cities as well as Service de l'eau (Water Service) are affected.

Higher average temperatures have an impact on different seasons. They cause a longer summer and a shorter winter, among other things, which in turn have repercussions on various parameters related to climate.The effects of higher average temperatures on the built environment are mainly observed in the wintertime. The increased number of freezethaw cycles entails an accelerated deterioration of the roadway system (potholes). It also accelerates wear on bridges, tunnels and overpasses. Higher average temperatures also impact the growth rate and geographical distribution of some harmful insect species , which may result in more frequent infestations frequencies and intensified damages to plants. An increase of a few degrees can generate drastic changes in plant biology, which may alter species’ distribution areas and could stimulate the growth of undesirable plant species. Plant pathogens are also more likely to survive milder winters, which favour the expansion of their distribution area. Pathogenic species that cannot survive in current conditions could eventually attack plants in our region. Higher average summer temperatures could extend allergenic plants’ pollen production season, which can result in greater health problems for people who have allergies. The increase in average temperatures is also causing a northward migration of vectorborne pathogen animal populations; in recent years, we have observed an increase in the occurrence of Lyme disease and West Nile virus (WNV).Four categories of impacts have been identified, which includes many assets/services selection, but that have not been prioritized in terms of assets/services affected: the built environment, the population, the natural environment and municipal activities.

Under the Ecocities project (Cavan 2010) 3 climate zones were defined for GM.  The increases of heat stress (and max temp) is most prevalent for GM’s Mersey Basin zone. This increases the risk of negative impacts linked to high temperatures, such as negative health effects and reductions in the productivity of employees. this is particularly important due to economic activity concentrated in the city region core (and the Mersey basin zone) and the prevalence of vulnerable groups (deprived, health impacted, young and elderly) in the spatial locations projected to suffer the worse increases as well as urban heat island effect as a forcing factor on top.Therefore, the spatial pattern of GM’s urban heat island demonstrates that certain areas, generally those where development density is at its highest, are more likely to suffer from negative impacts as a result. There is also an equality dimension to heat stress. For example, looking at GM’s housing development types, there is greater potential exposure to heat stress in more deprived areas. In effect, groups that are vulnerable to heat stress, due to factors including poverty and poor health, show the highest potential exposure to this climate change impact.

There is also an equality dimension to heat stress. For example, looking at GM’s housing development types, there is greater potential exposure to heat stress in more deprived areas. In effect, groups that are vulnerable to heat stress, due to factors including poverty and poor health, show the highest potential exposure to this climate change impact.

Indeed, evidence from the EcoCities project suggests that flooding has been the most prominent hazard facing GM over recent decades, and that surface water flooding is superseding fluvial flooding (from main rivers) as the most common type of event (Carter and Lawson 2011). Indeed, pluvial flooding now dominates, accounting for 50% of all floods since 1994Within the GM Critical infrastructure risk assessment, which looked at 2050’s high GHG emissions scenario for GM’s Mersey Basin zone. Change is from 1961-1990 at 90th percentile) for this GM climate Zones (defined under the Ecocities project, Cavan 2010), under this emissions scenario, we expect the following hazard increases which will intensify the pluvial / flash flood risk by:Precipitation on wettest day in winter: + 31%- Precipitation on wettest day in summer: + 19%- Winter mean precipitation: +28%- Annual mean precipitation: +9% In addition to the damage flooding causes to buildings and infrastructure, flooding also brings knock-on secondary impacts which must be recognised. One example is the effect of flood damage to people’s homes, and the subsequent psychological stress that this can cause flood victims.

Indeed, evidence from the EcoCities project suggests that flooding has been the most prominent hazard facing GM over recent decades, and that surface water flooding is superseding fluvial flooding (from main rivers) as the most common type of event (Carter and Lawson 2011). Although fluvial flooding is relatively uncommon in GM, given the location of key assets and infrastructures within Flood Zones and the high consequences of related impacts should they occur, the associated risks remain high. Indeed GM is already seeing an intensification in its fluvial flood hazard. With 17 river flood events in the 1945-1969 period rising to 27 in the 1994-2017 period.  Again this is a hazard GM projects to increase in intensity and risk.

An increase in temperature is expected to reduce the duration of development of vectors/pests, such that there will be an increase in population that leads to high transmission all year round or increased force of infection. Moreover, the biting rate of mosquitoes is expected to increase while the replication time of pathogens is expected to shorten. Thus, this would lead to an increase in transmission of vector-borne disease, in particular dengue. Finally, there is also an increased risk of new pathogen(s) being established under a hotter climate. The study has also projected that there is an increasing trend in rainfall, particularly during the wetter season. An increase in intermittent rainfall may create more mosquito larval habitats and increase mosquito population.

Multiple issues account for the increasing impacts. Some of them are the general increase in the per unit impervious surface area attributed to new developments around the city hinter-lands.

This is corroborated by 36% of reported Out Patient Department cases being  those of Upper Respiratory Tract Infections.   The Urban Health Initiative which is a pilot project being funded by the WHO in Accra identifies that health impacts of a Business-As-Usual scenario will lead to an annual loss of 78 lives  per 1000 population if no intervention is designed to eradicate air pollution or reduce its effect.  Average health costs per period of hospitalisation for the treatment of URTIs  was estimated  at 1,257 and only 59% of this cost could be covered by some form of health insurance. However the proportion of population covered by any form of health insurance policy remains less than 50 percent. Thus the economic impact of air pollution related diseases remains a major source of income loss for affected population and their dependent household members.

The maximum increase occurred from 1930 to 1970 due to the combined effects of subsidence and eustatism. After that period, and until 2008, m.s.l. seems to attain a fairly constant value. After 2008 m.s.l. shows again an increasing trend. The increase in the number of high water levels (>110cm) since the sixties is evident. While at the beginning of the previous century we can observe one event with water levels >110 cm per year, in the past years we have, on average, 5-6 event per year. Analogously, the number of events with very low water levels has decreased.For other information, see the web page of the center for Tidal Forecast and Early Warning  http://www.comune.venezia.it/it/content/centro-previsioni-e-segnalazioni-maree

Furthermore, due to the climate changes caused by global heating, the risks of floods and coastal erosion in the territory of Riga city are still growing.Considering the geographical, hydro-geological and climate situation of Riga, the following three main types of natural causes of river flood can be distinguished:1.	River flood caused by strong wind.2.	Spring river flood.3.	Flood caused by intense rainfall and rising groundwater level.In the case of strong northwest storms more often are flooded Rutku island, Mangaļu peninsula, the right bank of Daugava, Daugavgrīva, Bolderāja, areas from Krievu island to Krēmeri un Voleri, Lucavsala island, partly the right bank of Zakusala island as well as other relatively low urban areas.The city of Riga may be threatened by a combination of several causes of flooding, i.e. increased flooding can be caused by a sea surge caused by a storm in combination with a relatively large flow rate in the Daugava. The threat of complex sea storms and spring flooding is present not only in the areas adjacent to the Daugava, but also in the system of branches and lakes – Ķīšezers and Juglas lakes.In the city of Riga, the territories that are threatened by probable floods were identified and which need to be protected due to the inhabitants, cultural and historical values, economic activities, planned development of the territory and historical environmental pollution. Territorial estimation was carried out for the near future climate change scenario, for the period 2021-2050 with a probability of 1% repetition of floods or once every 100 years, and 8 flooding areas that need to be protected from flooding were identified:1.	Around the river Buļļupe (Vakarbuļļi, Rītabuļļi, Daugavgrīva, Bolderāja).2.	Around Vecdaugava.3.	Around Hapaka ditch and Beķera ditch (Krēmeri, Voleri, Spilve).4.	Around Ķīšezers lake, Juglas canal, Juglas lake and Baltezers lake.5.	Around Sarkandaugava.6.	Around Zunda canal (Ķīpsala, Klīversala, Mārupītes downhill).7.	Around Bieķen ditch (Mūkusala, Bieķen island, Lucavsala island).8.	Around Krasta Street from Salu bridge to Dienvidu (South) bridge."

The decline has been steepest in end-user fuel consumption (46,9% as compared to 2010), especially in the industrial sector. The second larger decrease in emissions has been in the district heating system.- In the other sectors (electrical power consumption and motor vehicles) the changes in emissions between 2010 and 2014 have been but negligible.- Most of the emissions in 2014 come from motor vehicles (40%) and heat consumption in the district heating supply system (29%); whereas the rest of the emissions come from fuel consumption in different consumer sectors (17%) and electrical power consumption (14%).Analysis of CO2 emissions in Riga by emission flow and source leads to conclude that there are four main sources of CO2 emissions: the district heating system, consumption of gas in the end-user sectors, fuel consumption by motor vehicles and electrical power consumption.

Experts say many sugarcane farmers – who form the core of the local farming industry – are unable to afford the pesticides required to contain the worm once it’s been detected, which could increase its chances of spreading further.The armyworms, which arrived in west Africa from the Americas early in 2016, spread south through Zambia and Zimbabwe before arriving in Africa’s biggest producer of maize. The alien pest, confirmed in SA in February, has already spread to all nine provinces, including eastern KwaZulu-Natal, where the bulk of cane is grown.

In addition to these factors, it is important to point out the issue of deforestation, which causes erosion, and the garbage dumped in the hills, which causes overweight in the soil structures. Every year there are intense rains in the winter season. In 2015, there was a tragedy in which 15 people died due to landsliding in a poor neighborhood in Salvador. Since then, the city government has intensified efforts to reduce the impact of weather events and involve the local community. However, there are still many challenges due to lack of human resources and material, lack of support from some local leaderships due to political orientations that are contrary to the current government, and difficulty of access to some areas due to their precariousness. In the near future, heavy rains will continue to impact informal urban dwellers, due to the rapid urban expansion and the peculiar topography of Salvador.From the mapping carried out, it is possible to observe that the highest level of landslide threat is concentrated in the southern portion of the city of Salvador, decreasing as it approaches areas further north. The temporal analysis indicates a tendency to reduce the threat level over the analyzed periods, and in 2030 more areas are expected to be under high and very high threat compared to 2100.

In addition, estimates show that approximately 67% of the years between 1976-2099 show maximum annual precipitation on a day greater than 50 mm.  The flood risk map for the city shows that a good part of the territory, and consequently the population, may suffer from the increased risk of flooding, pointing to the years 2030, 2050 and 2100. The critical risk map, in the which points out the most critical areas in relation to the risk of heat wave points out that almost all administrative-areas have areas of critical risk

Meteorological drought is one of the threats that can directly and indirectly affect Salvador's population and supply system. Analyzes indicate that over the years, problems related to water deficit tend to accentuate, with the Pedra do Cavalo Dam region being more exposed to high and / or very high levels of drought threat in 2030, 2050 and 2100. Such factor can be related to the trend of reduced rainfall over the years. Thus, the lack of precipitation tends to increase the area of meteorological drought, mainly affecting the surroundings of Salvador.The factors that intensify the risk become the population's exposure and vulnerability. In this case, the housing deficit condition, together with population concentrations are the greatest forces in defining the areas with the highest risk. Income is an especially important factor for adaptation capacity related to drought, since the supply rate helps in the population's adaptive capacity, and consequently, in reducing their vulnerability.The meteorological drought risk map indicates that the part of the territory of Salvador located in the southwest, west, and northwest will be the regions that have the highest risk.

Salvador is already suffering from extreme daily rain events. In April 2020, for example, the city recorded, in one day, 1/3 of rain expected for the month, which means approximately 100mm. The analysis shows a tendency to reduce rainfall in the city of Salvador in the analyzed time series and points to an increase in interannual variability, that is, years of excess rain are projected much above the current normal and years of rain deficit much below normal . According to projections, the periods of consecutive days without rain will be longer, as well as the consecutive periods with rain will be shorter. The models indicate that the extreme daily rain events will occur with increasing accumulations. It is noteworthy that the projections of accumulated 5 days of rain show an increase over the 21st century, making the areas of the upper level of the municipality of Salvador more vulnerable to landslides, since there are declining slopes.

In this case, the condition of housing deficit, together with the concentrations of sensitive population (children and the elderly), especially in areas with less afforestation, are the greatest forces in defining the areas with the highest risk. Income is an especially important factor in the ability to adapt relatively to hot flashes, as it allows the adoption of technologies that can reduce risk. In addition, access to health systems was considered an adaptive capacity, since the greater the access to these services, the better prepared the region is to reduce the impacts on population health due to temperature spikes, as well as green areas, since the proximity of these areas can be understood as a factor that reduces the local temperature.The heat wave risk index map indicates that a good part of the territory, and consequently the population, may suffer from the increased risk of heat waves, this being pointed out for the years 2030, 2050 and 2100. The map of the critical risk, which points out the most critical areas in relation to the risk of heat wave points out that almost all city-halls have high risk.

It is noteworthy that in the analysis carried out, the climate was treated as a conditioning factor for the occurrence of the vector, and combating the foci of water accumulation, that is, favorable places for the creation of the disease-transmitting mosquito, the best way to avoid the proliferation of the disease.From the results it is possible to observe an increased threat of the proliferation of Aedes aegypti throughout the territory of Salvador in all periods analyzed. It is noted that the threat in the historical period is concentrated in the east of Salvador, on the coast close to the Atlantic Ocean, and for the projections of 2030, 2050 and 2100, the threat is increasing, penetrating almost the entire territory.The factors that intensify the risk are exposure and vulnerability to the population. In this case, in terms of sensitivity, the housing deficit condition, together with the concentrations of sensitive population (children and the elderly), the lack of access to supply, the reduced rate of garbage collection and the proximity to empty land are the factors to strengthen the definition of the areas with the highest risk. In terms of adaptive capacity, income, rates of literate women over 15 years of age, and access to the health system are factors that help to reduce the population's vulnerability.

Ilha de Maré, in turn, is identified as totally exposed to sea level rise, which should directly affect its occupied / urbanized areas, all located on the shore along the island. Although it is an area of small population, the size of the affected territory is quite expressive, which makes this region one of the most impacted by the dynamics, which is already underway, albeit slowly in the face of other urgencies.2) The Paripe region is reached in an area of consolidated urbanization and predominantly horizontal occupation. Despite the low density of the region, it is a considerable area of developed and occupied urban area, with an increased level of vulnerability due to the low income of the population, which can be more severely affected in situations of risk.3) Itapagipe Bay has a good part of its coastline affected by the increase in sea level - which are largely composed of occupations via landfills. This is one of the areas with the most significant impact in the entire municipality, due to the consolidated pattern of occupation, the size of the population and the amount of non-residential activities reached, and the symbolic-cultural significance of the area for the city. It is also a region highly sensitive to the risk of expulsion of the low-income population due to the impact of infrastructure adaptation interventions, which may constitute a process of social disruption that generates impacts throughout the city.4) The next region to the south follows the shore and goes from Feira de São Joaquim to Mercado Modelo. The impact on this area is also very high due to its constructive density and the existence of large infrastructure equipment, of extreme importance for the city, in the areas directly affected. There is also a significant opportunity for the constructive solution to be thought in terms converging with the urbanistic thinking currently in force on the part of the municipal public power, of valuing the region through the installation of the municipal secretariats in the neighborhood.5) The last major region comprises the coastline mostly appropriated by the population due to its beaches, impacting on tourism and employement

Este hecho se debe a que las lluvias intensas (desencadenante climático del fenómeno de movimientos en masa) incrementan progresivamente a medida que aumenta el horizonte temporal y el escenario climático. Dentro de cada escenario y horizonte temporal, los niveles de riesgo más altos se encuentran asociados a las diferentes quebradas, laderas del Pichincha y elevaciones volcánicas puesto que presentan una mayor susceptibilidad a los movimientos en masa, en comparación con la zona urbanizada de Quito, cuyas zonas periféricas son las que registran el mayor riesgo al ser las más susceptibles.Así, en los receptores de hábitat urbano y población los niveles de riesgo más altos se concentran en las zonas periféricas de las parroquias urbanas. Estas zonas no solo son las áreas más susceptibles a movimientos en masa, sino que son las más vulnerables; esto es, son las zonas que poseen un nivel socio-económico más bajo, viviendas de calidad constructiva más baja y una mayor densidad de población.

Por otra parte, los ríos que discurren en valles inundables de bajas pendientes pueden fluir por ellas dejando cauces abandonados e inundando nuevos terrenos.Las inundaciones, además, son provocadas por causas antrópicas, como taponamiento y rotura de sistemas de recolección de aguas lluvias y alcantarillado o colectores, relleno de los drenajes naturales (quebradas), impermeabilización de suelos que aumenta la cantidad y la velocidad del agua a evacuarse, tala de bosques, inadecuado uso de suelo, construcciones y asentamientos humanos cerca de las vertientes de agua y en las franjas de protección de cuencas hidrográficas, entre otras.Los niveles de riesgo más altos tienen lugar fundamentalmente en las parroquias urbanas del DMQ, donde los eventos de precipitaciones intensas presentan mayor problemática debido a las bajas pendientes y a la falta de capacidad hidráulica del sistema de alcantarillado en algunos puntos. Así, en el caso del receptor hábitat urbano, los niveles de riesgo relativamente más elevados se registran en general en la zona urbana del DMQ, resultado en su mayoría del cruce de las edificaciones con vulnerabilidad a inundaciones moderada y un nivel de peligrosidad alto o muy alto. La vulnerabilidad está asociada a la calidad constructiva de las edificaciones en combinación con el nivel socioeconómico de cada manzana.Respecto al receptor población, la situación de la población en zonas de riesgo alto y muy alto representa un 9% y un 22%, para los escenarios RCP 4.5 (2016-2040) y RCP 8.5 (2041-2070), respectivamente.

Es debido a que el nivel de amenaza es asimismo muy alto en todo el territorio y, por consiguiente, su exposición. Las variaciones que existen en el nivel de riesgo se deben a la componente de vulnerabilidad. Considerando el receptor “hábitat urbano”, por ejemplo, predomina un nivel de riesgo “Alto” y “Muy alto” con un total del 97% de la superficie del DMQ. Este nivel se debe no solo a la alta peligrosidad, sino también a la alta y/o moderada vulnerabilidad, que viene caracterizada por el bajo nivel socioeconómico de la población y la baja accesibilidad de las zonas verdes.A destacar la espacialización del riesgo en relación a los espacios naturales, vinculado a la sensibilidad frente a incendios forestales. Como es de esperar, el mayor riesgo se concentra en las laderas con altas pendientes y orientación sur y sureste.Las consecuencias de la isla de calor urbana son muy variadas, desde la reducción del gasto energético por uso de calefacción en invierno hasta el aumento de la demanda por refrigeración en verano, con especial agravio en eventos de calor extremo como las olas de calor y sus consiguientes riesgos para la salud, así como la propia alteración de la flora y fauna urbanas.

The city’s infrastructure is aging, and in the event of a 100 year flood event as much as $3.6 Billion in damage is estimated. The ongoing Deep Rock Tunnel project is aimed to mitigate the potential impact of such events but is unlikely to eliminate it altogether. City is also implementing a 20-year, $320 million storm water capital improvement program to eliminate identified neighborhood flooding and drainage issues. In 2016, severe flooding occurred causing 15,000 residents to lose power. Between 2013 and 2018, there were 15 floods and 22 flash floods causing a total of $377.8 thousand dollars in damages. Spring and Summer of 2019 have been some of the wetter months on record according to Weather.gov. Average rainfalls from February through April were well above the 2.3 to 3.8 inch averages. May’s precipitation was below the 5.05 inch record at just 4.16 inches, but June’s precipitation was close to double the average at 7.51 inches. July and August both hovered near the average.

Hotter summers will also result in increased education costs. Currently, Indianapolis Public Schools sends children with asthma to air conditioned schools. Schools without air conditioning will need to find ways to provide a comfortable learning environment. Increased heat waves in intensity and duration typically produce air quality stagnation which increases PM2.5 and ozone levels. Public health faces greater jeopardy not only from the heat but also the deterioration of air quality associated with it. Children, older adults, those with underlying health issues, and anyone working outdoors are at a greater risk. In addition, increases in pollution levels reduce crop yields and also decrease the visibility, both of which have economic and quality of life impacts. The last heat wave recorded by NOAA was in 2000, which resulted in one death. In 2017, there was a heat wave in Marion County that included multiple days with heat indices of approximately 100 degrees.

A study from 2018 found that though the number of tornadoes in the United States hasn't increased significantly, but the locations of the tornados are shifting more from the Great Plains area to the Midwest, including Indiana. Tornadoes in 2016 and 2014 damaged 100 homes and over 200 vehicles.  In 2019, Marion County saw an EF0 and an EF1 tornado, which were the first confirmed touchdowns since 2016.

The risk for heat-related health impacts is highest amongst infants, young children, the elderly over 65, those already ill, athletes, those spending time outside, including outdoor workers, those engaging in physical activity, and those who don’t have access to air conditioning (Climate Central, “U.S. faces dramatic rise in extreme heat, humidity”, 2016), as well as those in more urban areas within the city, due an increase in the Urban Heat Island effect (Environmental Protection Agency & Center for Disease Control, 2016). Since 9.4% of Orlando’s residents are over the age of 65, 7.1% are under five years old, and one-in-five of all residents (20.2%) live at or below the poverty line, which is above average among the lower 48 states (U.S. Census Bureau, 2017), we have a large representation of groups are considered to be especially vulnerable to extreme heat. Furthermore, during dangerously hot days, the risk for these heat-related effects sharply increases and can reach even healthy young adults to middle-aged individuals. According to current predictions, annual heat-related deaths will increase to tens-of-thousands by the end of the century (Climate Central, “U.S. faces dramatic rise in extreme heat, humidity”, 2016), and, with the projections for our region, many of these deaths will occur in Central Florida. For individuals and families with pets that spend some or all of their time outside or do not have air conditioning, this also presents a serious risk (Florida Division of Emergency Management, 2013). These heat impacts may also provide a strain on the healthcare system when faced with increased hospitalizations and doctors’ visits, need for home care, and insurance claims. (Climate Central, “U.S. faces dramatic rise in extreme heat, humidity”, 2016).The impacts from high heat also interact with other climate hazards that can result in amplified risks. This elevated heat can contribute to stagnant air, which has been increasing in Central Florida, and allows dangerous levels of both air pollutants and ground-level ozone to build up in the local area (Climate Central, “Stagnant air on the rise, upping ozone risk”, 2016).

Additionally, this risk may be even higher for the large number of visitors to Orlando who may be less familiar with the frequency and danger of lightning and the need to take shelter, even when storms are not directly overhead.These strikes can also result in damages to the local electric infrastructure, which may already be strained due to other storm elements, such as heavy winds, as well as commercial and residential property damage, and add to the risk of wildfires (as discussed in the corresponding section of this document).

Carbon monoxide poisoning can occur during or after the storm has passed if gas-powered generators are placed in an area without proper ventilation, as occurred during the series of Florida hurricanes in 2005. Additionally, populations sensitive to heat, such as the elderly, may be left without power for air conditioning for extended periods of time resulting in injury and fatalities, as tragically occurred in South Florida after Hurricane Irma (Fritz, 2017; Ochoa, 2017). Finally, foodborne illness can result due to lack of power for refrigeration, and water-borne illness from drinking or preparing food with water that has been contaminated from the strains on water reclamation facilities and other sources of water pollution (Florida Department of Health, 2015).

Increasing	Increasing	Medium Low	Immediately	Often drought conditions in Florida first impact the agricultural sector. However, since this industry is very limited in Orlando, the impacts are more likely to be first seen across surface water in the City’s lakes and streams, as well as subsurface ground water upon which we depend for our potable water for drinking, plumbing, and irrigation. Impacts on local flora and smaller community gardens and urban agriculture may also be experienced.The effect of droughts in the region would also be dangerous for its impacts on other hazards. By lowering water tables and compromising the integrity of soil for holding large amounts of water, droughts present an elevated risk for sinkholes. The dry conditions also raise the risk for wildfires.The local impacts of water regulations could impact the hospitality and tourism sectors, including the water-based attractions at local theme parks, attractions, and hotels, as well as local ecotourism, such as tubing, paddleboarding, and kayaking in local lakes, streams, and springs. Since these industries represent a large portion of the local economy, these impacts could have a significant negatively influence. Additionally, with damages to the statewide agricultural industry, prices on a number of crops, including oranges, grapefruit, sweet corn, watermelons, cucumbers, squash, snap peas and sugar cane, as well as beef, could rise due to reduced supply.

The total value of structures at risk for wildfire damage (broken down by occupancy type in the table above) in Orange County is $17,197,000,000, with an estimated annualized loss of $1,405,000 and the total value of County facilities (shown with values in table below) is $1,454,500,000 with an estimated annualized loss of $32,610 (Florida Division of Emergency Management, 2013). The greatest loss potential lies in the single-family residential homes, many of which lie within the WUI in Orlando.Any wildfire activity will result in damage to forested lands and protected natural lands that provide habitats and nesting areas for local wildlife and valuable biodiversity within the region (Florida Division of Emergency Management, 2013), which could negative economic impacts not only for the previously occupied structures, but also future development potential in the area.There is also a possibility for death and injuries, although less common, during the early stages of wildfires and throughout the process of evacuation. A higher risk of harm exists for responders involved in the fire suppression, particularly if the fire grows or suddenly changes directions.Other dangers include possible transportation disruption across the interstate system, as was the case during Florida wildfires in 2012, which can affect local residents as well as the many visitors to the region.

Models project those trends will continue, increasing flood damage risks to infrastructure. The Department of Public Utilities is creating a tool that involves collaboration between DPU, the Department of Public Safety, Columbus Police, and Columbus Fire on the creation of roadway routing for emergency and residential vehicles.

The number of days dry enough to plant crops in the spring may be reduced and the potential for rain on semi-frozen ground may increase. The agricultural sector will likely see an increased need for irrigation and controlled drainage and may need to treat livestock for infection and disease. The city will likely see increased infrastructure and property damage due to extreme weather and flooding.

To reduce residents' vulnerability to sun exposure and intense heat,  some city recreation centers extended their hours . Mayor Ginther released the following statement:  “I encourage residents to take care during extreme heat,” said Mayor Ginther.  “Our community centers are a safe place to cool off.” Temperatures are expected to continue rising and the frequency of extreme heat days are predicted to increase. In the future, Columbus may need to keep recreation centers open more often to ensure resident safety and will need to create a more robust public-private network of resilience hubs for residents to use during extreme weather events.  This pace of extremely hot days continued into 2019 with a similar extended extreme heat event occurring in late July 2019.  https://www.10tv.com/article/news/local/5-columbus-rec-centers-remain-open-weekend-help-people-beat-heat-2019-jul/530-dbce69d9-0f17-450d-bc6e-ce0c2030e861.

During heavy rain events water flows through storm sewers under the force of gravity to lower elevations including the city’s major rivers. During elevated river levels, flow in storm sewers may reverse direction and flow from the river into protected areas. Floodgates and backflow preventers are designed to restrict water flow from inundating these protected areas, but this could be an area of impact in the future. There could be an increased need for water treatment due to deteriorated water quality.

For the purposes of Edmonton VRA, this was defined as an event with accumulated snowfall of at least 50 cm. A heavy snowfall causes transportation disruptions and can also increase the likelihood of car accidents with associated injuries and fatalities. It can also increase the incidence of heart attacks from snow shoveling. Both these impacts put additional stress on emergency management services and personnel. Newer homes and buildings in the city are designed to withstand a larger snowfalls; however, some older structures may be challenged by new snow loads. The consequences for Edmonton's electricity grid could be widespread, but impacts would be short-lived and less serious. The extent of the impacts depends on the duration and timing of the event. A heavy snow event in May or September, when there are leaves on the trees, could cause significant tree damage and increase the likelihood of power outages. Vulnerable populations include low income individuals living in older, less structurally sound homes that are less able to withstand heavy snow loads. A power outage in the middle of winter can have a significant impact on the homeless and low income individuals and families. Individuals predisposed to heart failure and disease are also particularly vulnerable.

For the purposes of Edmonton VRA, these are defined as wind gusts reaching or exceeding a speed of 90 km per hour.Regarding the built environment, severe winds can affect buildings and construction sites, potentially blowing siding, shingles, and solar panels off houses, blowing over cranes, or blowing debris off construction sites. Damage to buildings and property is exacerbated when winds are widespread and longer lasting. If widespread, a severe wind event impacting a major construction site could result in injuries and fatalities, with major implications for emergency management services. Severe wind can impact the environment, notably the urban canopy, damaging trees, which will increase maintenance costs and disrupt access to parks. Depending on the number of downed trees, this could have a major impact on waste management services, which is not equipped to collect tree debris. Other environmental impacts from severe wind could include soil erosion with potential consequences for vegetation germination, and mixing layers in the water column, which could lead to the development of cyanobacteria. Telecommunications and electricity transmissions infrastructure is built to withstand this level of wind event. However, electricity distribution lines could be impacted, with some isolated power outages. Vulnerable populations include the homeless and low income individuals and families. These populations have limited ability to take shelter during a severe wind event, and tend to live in older, lower quality homes that are less able to withstand winds without experiencing damage. These vulnerable populations also have difficulty evacuating and often don't have access to private automobiles.

This hazard was specifically identified as an important hazard for consideration and prioritization for Edmonton's adaptation strategy. This impact is defined as rain that freezes on impact to form a coating of clear ice on the ground and on exposed objects. For Edmonton's VRA, this hazards was defined as years with one or more freezing rain events meeting the minimum Environment and Climate Change Canada's warning criteria.Freezing rain is rain that freezes on impact to form a coating of clear ice on the ground and on exposed objects. Freezing rain has the most severe impacts on the following asset and service areas: road transportation, electricity system, and information and communications infrastructure.Regarding the road network, freezing rain causes increased maintenance costs and can also lead to vehicle accidents with associated injuries and fatalities. Freezing rain on surfaces also increases the risk of slips and falls, leading to injuries.Freezing rain will affect electricity distribution infrastructure, leading to increased incidence of power outages, as well as delays in restoring power following an outage (due to concurrent disruption to the road network). High voltage lines will experience some sagging, but if they failed the impacts could be more widespread and significant. A major power outage affecting the downtown core would have major impacts.Information and communications infrastructure, primarily microwave towers, could also be impacted by freezing rain causing service losses. Indirect impacts associated with power outages and telecommunication disruption could be widespread, and affecting multiple service areas: water supply, buildings, rail transport, public health and safety and the economy. No specific vulnerable populations were identified.

For the purposes of Edmonton's VRA, heat wave conditions are defined as  five consecutive days with maximum temperature greater or equal to 29 degrees Celsius.Regarding the rail network, heat waves can lead to ""sun kinks"" on the rail line, damaging rail infrastructure and causing transport disruption, with indirect economic impacts due to supply/customer chain disruption. Heat waves can also impact road transportation, including bus transit services, causing overheating. Vulnerable populations, such as the homeless who have limited ability to take shelter during a heat wave, and low income individuals and families who have limited ability to pay space cooling costs (or have access to air conditioning), are particularly at risk to adverse health outcomes. Another vulnerable group are people who work outdoors. Individuals among these groups with existing pulmonary or cardiovascular conditions are most at risk. There are proven associations between heat stress and a range of adverse health effects. Health risks are compounded if extreme heat is accompanied by weather conditions conducive to the formation of smog or a general deterioration in air quality. An intense, long duration heat wave has potential to cause power outages associated with high air conditioning use and reduced efficiency on lines; accompanied by adverse health impacts associated with heat stress, this could lead to an emergency situation. Historically heat waves in Edmonton have not been as common as cold spells, and the city is not as prepared to deal with severe heat waves."

For the purposes of Edmonton's VRA, extreme hot days are defined as  a day with maximum temperature greater or equal to 29 degrees Celsius.A single hot day could give rise to adverse health outcomes among particularly vulnerable groups; individuals with existing pulmonary or cardiovascular conditions, living along, and unable to mitigate exposure or sensitivity to the heat due to socio-economic circumstances. There is a small risk of rail snaking. Users of public transport may also experience some discomfort due to overheating on buses.

For the purposes of Edmonton's VRA, drought was specifically defined by a Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) value of -2 or below.Droughts can have consequences on the urban forest, parks, and aquatic environment in Edmonton. Birch trees can be particularly impacted due to their shallow root systems which cannot tolerate drought. Drought can impact aquatic life, via reduced water levels and increased water temperature, which can lead to a deterioration in water quality. Compared to other parts of the province, Edmonton's food system is not very well equipped to deal with drought. Drought will affect commercial crops and home and community gardens, causing reduced productivity and in extreme cases crop failure. Most crops in the Edmonton area are not drought resistant. Reduced agricultural output will have indirect economic impacts on supply/customer chains, though commercial losses will likely be insured. For the water supply system, drought can reduce available water supply and could lead to water use restrictions.

For Edmonton's VRA, this was specifically defined as 80 mm of rainfall during an event, with the majority (>40 mm) occurring in a short period (<2 hrs).High intensity rainfalls can overwhelm stormwater management infrastructure and cause flooding of streets, homes, and commercial property. The consequences for the built environment can be significant; and include damage to buildings and contents, with potential economic impacts to affected businesses. If drainage infrastructure is damaged, or malfunctions, consequences for low-lying roads and underpasses can be severe, causing major transport disruptions. Injuries and even fatalities on affected routes are possible. Clean-up costs can be significant. In areas of the city with combined water and sewer and systems, intense rainfall can overwhelm the sewage treatment system and cause sewage backup into homes, as well as the release of untreated sewage into the North Saskatchewan River. No specific vulnerable populations were identified.

There is, however, the potential for significant additional impacts that will affect our supply chains notably regard to food. In the medium to long-term we also expect to see displacement of individuals with Charlotte being a natural destination where people would want to live. This additional warming is likely to lead to increased incidences of certain diseases becoming more prevalent in Charlotte. With this increased warming and its associated climatic impacts there is a real potential for energy supplies to be negatively impacted – as these, similar to food, will extend long way beyond Charlotte’s borders. Each of these impacts can be interlinked and show how Charlotte will be impacted in a systems context.

They are mainly connected with higher temperatures and changes in the precipitations, In regard to the temperatures, the statistical significance and the sustainability of the results for all periods and scenarios provide a strong basis for the following conclusions: - A significant rise in average temperatures is expected by mid-century in both climate scenarios, with RCP4 .5, are achieved by the middle of the century at RCP8.5. As a consequence, an equivalent change follows for the vegetation period.- Expectations of a significant rise in extremely high temperatures are still in the middle of the century and in both scenarios, with the conclusion being true both for the day and for the night. Also, an equivalent increase is expected for the duration of the hot periods. RCP4.5 results for the end of the century are achieved in RCP8.5 by the middle of the century. - Considerable warming is expected during the cold periods in both scenarios by the middle of the century, with RCP4.5's end-of-century results attained by mid-century at RCP8.5. The number of days of freezing as well as frosting falls significantly. A significant decrease in the length of the cold waves, as for RCP8.5 long periods of cold weather practically do not expect until the end of the century.Rainfall results are more uncertain, but there is some basis for the following conclusions: - Rare, but more intense rainfall is expected on an annual basis. Longer periods of drought are expected.- Winter is expected to be wetter, with less, but more intense rainfall. Overall, this conclusion is not particularly certain about RCP4.5; for RCP8.5 the indication is clearer.- More dry summers are expected with less precipitation. For RCP4.5, there is some certainty about this towards the end of the century; for RCP8.5 this is also true for the middle of the century.

However with increasing intensity of storms, urban intensification and increased proportion of impermeable surfaces, the ability of its existing infrastructure to cope will be tested. Additionally, an increase in storm frequency and/or intensity will increase demands on our emergency services.Climate projections for the water cycle indicate even more reduced reliability of evenly spread rain throughout the year. In the mid to longer term, winter and early spring rain is projected to decrease, but there will be more intense rain events in the warmer months of late spring and summer. There is a high degree of uncertainty about the annual average in the longer term. With decreasing reliability of rainfall, plant life will become stressed and this has flow-on effects for natural ecosystems and urban landscapes.

Lightning strikes also pose a risk as they have the potential to cause serious bushfires. The 2003 ACT bushfires created a firestorm that was difficult for firefighting services to contain, resulting in loss of life and a great number of homes. The impacts of these events would be of a regional scale. The numerous 2019-20 bushfires in eastern Australia were predominantly started by lightning strikes, and Canberra was fortunate to have not received direct strikes across the bushfire season. The bushfires surrounded Canberra and their smoke caused hazardous levels of air pollution in the city for many weeks.

The effect of drought could potentially damage plants, animals, wildlife habitat, and air and water quality. It could also increase forest and range fires leading to a reduced landscape quality. There will be a strain on the city’s water resources and cause conflicts between water users, inequities in the distribution of impacts and drought relief and public safety and health. Increased instances of drought will economically impact agriculture and related sectors. This may potentially inflate food prices, energy and other products as supplies are reduced.

Most flooding occurs over a short period and affects relatively localised areas.  Flooding is dependent on several factors including rainfall intensity and duration, soil conditions, local river levels and the physical characteristics of the catchment.  The conditions that lead to flooding in Auckland are often dependent on whether the catchments are predominantly rural or urban. Auckland has approximately 100 urbanised catchments and 130 rural catchments.  Ground conditions influence flooding in rural catchments as run-off to streams and rivers occurs much faster if soils are already saturated. The majority of the flood risk in the Auckland region is in urbanised catchments where development within floodplains and obstruction of overland flow paths increases the incidence and risk of flooding of homes and buildings.

It could be a danger to life in the case of sudden onset landslide events and structural damage or destruction of buildings and infrastructure. In addition, it could severely damage or destruct lifeline infrastructure such as water, sewage and gas pipes and roads. And cause major damage to commercial transportation infrastructure that may require significant time to repair and lead to economic loss.  In Auckland, landslides and soil erosion occur in soft, weak soils that have been weathered over many thousands of years. There is potential danger to life in the case of sudden landslides due to damage or destruction of buildings and impacts on lifeline infrastructure. Also, it may lead to loss of land, particularly in coastal cliff environments, destabilization of neighbouring slopes and properties and environmental impacts of sedimentation in waterways.

Increased heat will also impact infrastructure with potential disruption to power and water supply as well as the structural integrity of road and rails during periods of extreme heat. An increase in extreme hot days will also impact the natural environment and associated services with detrimental effects for those unable to adapt with risks to food production and biodiversity.

Fires in these areas can be caused by agricultural burn-off getting out of control, arson, careless activities such as campfires in restricted locations, or natural causes such as lightning strikes. Weather contributes significantly to the risk of wildfire. Prolonged drought can provide tinder dry conditions and strong winds can buffet and spread wildfire easily. Auckland Council undertakes a Regional Wildlife Threat Analysis to assess the vulnerability.

More specifically, projections for the mean annual rainfall in Wellington predict winter rainfall could increase by up to 15%. To date, Wellington has experienced minor flooding events from rain/storm events, mainly in vulnerable suburbs. Such events have seen that the hilly geography of the city has caused some slope failure and resulted in occasional road closures - these have been quickly cleared thus far. However, it is likely the frequency and magnitude of slope failure will increase under future rainfall projections. Of further note, there is a very real and high chance of earthquake-induced slop failure to contend with. So far, Wellington city has not seen major siltation or land subsidence yet but they are likely to increase as the frequency and intensity of rain events increases if this is not first affected by an earthquake.

Buried infrastructure will likely see saltwater intrusion, and some infrastructure already finds itself underwater at high tide.  The CBD will be impacted and services will have to be protected or relocated; this is already noticeable as basement infrastructure is expereincing water intrusion at high tide and storm surge levels. Coastal residents will have to be protected or relocated, and we are already seeing implications for insurance on coastal properties. Essentially, Wellington is very vulnerable to sea-level rise and the associated coastal flooding. The CBD is built on reclaimed land and is highly susceptible to liquefaction from sea-level rise or an earthquake event. Furthermore, we have rebuilt the seawall on parts of the southern coast of the city following a severe storm in the last couple of years. We have large residential populations of the city who are in low-lying areas that are already experiencing storm surge flooding.  Modelling of sea-level rise in the CBD shows severe implications towards the end of this century but we are aware of these risks and they are becoming increasingly front and centre of council priorities and strategies. A particular concern to the city is the wastewater treatment plant located at sea-level on the exposed southern coastline. As the sea rises, this plant will increasingly be at risk of inundation during storm surges. Furthermore, storms can cause direct physical damage to low-lying wastewater treatment plants and pumping stations from waves and wind and indirect damage through power outages.

This is expected to increase following the increase in frequency and intensity of rain and storm events coupled with sea-level rise. In the long term, coastal residents and those in low-lying suburbs will need to be relocated or protection measures put in place. Wellington's stormwater infrastructure will need to be upgraded to cope with greater volumes of water. Other tools include early warning systems, stronger planning policy to restrict development in at risk areas or to build in extra storage capacity along with public education initiatives - essentially, more resilient design is required. Flash flooding events will also accelerate coastal erosion. To date, Wellington, particularly the greater Wellington region has experienced increasing coastal erosion which has propelled plans for a gradual retreat combined with sand dune nourishment as part of a buffer zone, which will become an approach likely to be adopted by other councils throughout New Zealand when vulnerable areas they manage experience similar impacts.

It is anticipated that the Wellington region will experience longer dry spells and shorter wet spells. This will impact pasture production and crop growth in this region particularly; there will be less water for services coupled with an increasing population; wildfire risk will increase in summer months in regions surrounding Wellington which will ensure greater demand for fire services.  Wellington is currently the only city in the region that does not use water meters, as water scarcity has typically not affected Wellington City. However, as precipitation changes are expected to occur across the region, Wellington has been prompted to examine its own water use and reduction opportunities to better manage regional water resources.

This will lead to coastal residents being highly vulnerable particularly in low-lying suburbs as well as infrastructure and utilities set to be affected. Of note, Wellington has a small tidal range which will impact the severity of the storm surges that do occur.  In February 2018 the vulnerable suburb of Makara was badly impacted by a storm surge which flooded homes and destroyed properties. This event led to a consultation process between Wellington City Council and the residents of Makara. This engagement process was extensive, and will be difficult to scale up when applied to a larger community - more investigative work needs to be done in this area, in anticipation for adaptation planning conversations with vulnerable communities.  In 2019 and early 2020, storm surges on our southern coast have seen numerous instances of road flooding, sea water inundation over property lines, and large-scale road and beach clean-ups required. In general, our early warning system has provided residents with time to prepare their properties for potential risk, but these events are becoming more and more commonplace.

Increasing	Increasing	High	Medium-term (2026-2050)	Wellington is already the windiest city in the world with an annual average windspeed of 18 miles/hr, and average wind gusts of 40-60 miles/hr.  The number of windy days is projected to increase across the region with the southern coast and hilltop suburbs most at risk of being adversely affected. Wellington is likely to experience stronger extreme winds into the future, with a 2-3% increase in the number of windy days expected by 2090. Effects Wellington has historically experienced include roofs being lifted off houses, trees being felled, the toppling of power poles, traffic lines and general damage to homes. This is expected to continue, affecting utilities delivery, emergency services call-outs, and damage to infrastructure. These are considerations for Wellington when it comes to building code requirements, renewable energy generation (capacity of wind turbines and roof-mounted solar panels to deal with extreme gusts), and building envelope design to reduce cold, drafty homes.

The longest drought was 59 months from May 1952 until April 1957. The average duration of drought for Louisville is eight months.  Droughts of 2007 and 2010 severely affected agriculture, wildfire risk, power generation, water prices, and ferry traffic. In addition, water quality in streams and rivers declined, and barges on the Ohio River were forced to reduce their cargo weight during drought, due to low river levels. Model projections show that overall drought stress is expected to increase in Louisville, even as average precipitation increases by 9%, on average. Because of much higher temperatures projected for the area, a modest increase in precipitation is not sufficient for offsetting higher evaporation and evapotranspiration rates. With continued higher emissions, drought stress is expected to increase 10-18% (14% on average) by the middle of this century. By late century, drought stress is expected to increase 10-21% (16% on average). If emissions are reduced, drought stress can be limited to 12-13%, on average, by mid to late-century.  Some effects of drought, combined with a heat wave, include crop failure, water shortage, wildfire, erosion, ecological damage, and land subsidence.

This was a finding of the city's Preliminary Resilience Assessment. Climate change is causing increases in temperature across the Southeastern United States. Since 1970, average annual temperatures in the region have increased by about 2°F, with the greatest warming occurring during the summer. Temperatures are projected to increase by 4°F to 8°F by the end of the century. There are also more predicted days over 95°F and fewer predicted freezing events. Across the Southeast, temperatures will vary somewhat over space and time. Inland areas are projected to warm more than coasts. Natural cycles, including the El Niño Southern Oscillation, tropical weather systems, and differences in atmospheric pressure across key regions of the Earth, are anticipated to drive short-term temperature fluctuations.Heavy downpours have also increased in the Southeastern United States. There has also been a substantial increase in the intensity, frequency, duration, and strength of Atlantic hurricane activity since the 1980s, and further increases are projected. However, in addition to some very wet periods, the region has also experienced periods of extreme drying. Projecting future precipitation for the Southeastern United States is challenging because the region lies in the transition between an increasingly wet northern region and a drying southwest. The northeastern areas of the Southeast U.S. (such as Tennessee) may experience wetter conditions, with natural variability having a strong influence on patterns across the entire region.Source, U.S. EPA: https://19january2017snapshot.epa.gov/climate-impacts/climate-impacts-southeast_.htmlMetro's 2019 Threat and Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment can be found here: https://www.nashville.gov/Portals/0/SiteContent/OEM/docs/MultiHazardMitigation/public%20full%20thira%202019.pdfMayor Cooper's 2020 re-promulgation and adoption of Metro Nashville-Davidson County's Multi-Hazard Mitigation Plan with a public statement directly linking identified risks to climate change: https://www.nashville.gov/Portals/0/SiteContent/OEM/docs/MultiHazardMitigation/cooper%20promulgation%20adoption%2005_08_20.pdf

This followed an historical 2-day rainfall with a statistical recurrence interval of greater than 1,000 years. Widespread flooding in the region led to 26 flood-related deaths, including 11 in Nashville, with a disproportionate number of elderly victims. Record flood stages on the Harpeth and Cumberland Rivers and the tributaries led to more than $2 billion in damages, more than 11,000 damaged structures, and to the closing of 115 roads including major interstates (I-24 and I-40). Infrastructure damage was extensive, with significant damage to water and wastewater treatment plants, pump stations, and distribution and collection systems, along with damage to roads and electrical substations, including the system that provides power to the downtown business core. Major tourist attractions incurred millions of dollars in damage. Over 13,000 jobs were temporarily or permanently lost, and est. $3.6 billion of commerce was permanently disrupted. As the recovery process transitioned into mitigation, a unified approach to flood preparedness was deemed necessary to avoid overlap of efforts, coordinate benefits of combined solutions, and maximize available resources of all stakeholders. The Unified Flood Preparedness Plan identified and evaluated flood damage reduction measures on the Cumberland River and its 5 major tributaries through a collaborative stakeholder approach. The plan identifies locations that would benefit from flood-damage reduction projects and the most beneficial solutions for each location so that as funding became available, Metro knows what and where to invest.https://www.nashville.gov/Portals/0/SiteContent/WaterServices/docs/reports/UFPP%20Final%20report.pdf

Cities 2020	49339	City and County of Honolulu	United States of America	North America	Climate Hazards and Vulnerability	Climate Hazards	1		Storm and wind > Cyclone (Hurricane / Typhoon)	Yes	High	High	Increased risk to already vulnerable populations	Energy; Public health; Water supply & sanitation	Indigenous population; Low-income households; Marginalized groups	Increasing	Increasing	Medium	Immediately	Tropical cyclones are the most devastating natural hazard threatening Hawaii, and the frequency and intensity of these storms has been increasingly due to climate change and warming ocean waters. East-facing coastlines receive the brunt of strong onshore winds as storms approach the island, while the south and west coastlines feel onshore winds as the storms pass to the west. Coastlines facing the passing storms usually are adversely impacted by both wind and storm surge damage, and history has shown that the islands do not have to take a direct hit from a storm to sustain a high level of damage. In addition to damage from high winds, tropical storms generate large swells that cause varying degrees of damage. This is the hallmark of hurricanes that pass close to but do not directly impact the islands. Impacts from large swells can be severe and lead to beach erosion, large waves, and marine overwash. Worst-case scenarios occur when the storm surge occurs concurrently with high tide. Indirect costs include the widespread distribution of debris, accidental spills of fuel, sewage and industrial waste, household chemicals, or other contaminants onto the land or into the marine environment; in addition to environmental damage associated with storm debris or material cleanup, including the loss of landfill capacity. Post-storm debris management can be another problem. This occurs when vast amounts of vegetation debris, including potentially toxic, treated building materials from destroyed buildings, as well as other materials are burned at different sites with little management. The damage to and destruction of the built environment, particularly public infrastructure such as transportation, utilities, and communications often represents enormous economic, social, and general functional costs to a community, while also impeding emergency response and recovery activities. A nonfunctional road can have major implications for a community: general loss of productivity; disruption of physical access preventing residents from getting to work or other daily activities, prevention of emergency vehicles from reaching their destinations, with the associated health and safety implications and the potential access difficulties causing the disruption of important lifeline supplies such as food and other deliveries to the community.

The primary environmental safety concern from drought is the wildfire hazard which is exacerbated during drought conditions, particular at the urban wildland interfaces in central Oahu. The ten driest years on record are all associated with El Niño years. Especially during times of a southerly shift in the atmospheric circulation system of the north Pacific (the Hadley Cell), when in combination with El Nino season, the Hawaiian Islands see a decrease in rainfall. Based on 20 El Nino events since 1905, it shows that the chance of having a dry winter (spring) following an onset of El Nino is 90% for winter and 80% for spring. Deficient rainfall observed during an El Nino winter is unlikely to have occurred by random chance. A moderate to severe drought affected the entire State from 1983 to 1986. Although not as intense on some islands as either the 1938-1947 or the 1970-1979 drought, nor as long, this drought caused cumulative stream flow deficits at some gaging stations that rank second for the period of record. El Nino conditions in the latter part of 2009 and into 2010 resulted in fewer winter storms putting the islands in severe drought conditions. The 2015 El Nino season was particularly severe The drought recurrence intervals calculated from the streamflow deficits ranged from about 10 to more than 25 years, depending on locality. Although Hawaii has experienced severe droughts, the most detrimental effects usually have been confined to limited areas. The areas most affected by drought are those that normally are dry and depend on winter rains and those that receive little rain from the trade winds. Other areas greatly affected are the areas that have no ground-water supply or water supply from another area. Since the decline of the sugar cane industry, which used to do the majority of the maintenance on the agricultural irrigation ditches and reservoirs, the reliability of irrigation water has declined around the state. Monitoring of the Hawaiian climate over the last 50 to 60 years indicates that there has been trend towards an increase in temperature and decrease in statewide rainfall, associated with global warming. Therefore, future incidences the intensity of drought are expected to increase.

Debris flows generally occur during or immediately after severe rainfall of more than 3 inches in a peak 6-hour period. They can sever or cover roads, blocking access to (or egress from) neighborhoods, and thus interfere with emergency operations and evacuations. The State has identified 66 highway sites on Oahu that have a high risk of rockfall (or landslide) and acknowledged that fixing all the problems could take years. A review of the transportation system on Oahu indicates that many miles of highways and roadways pass through mountainous terrain, where steeply cut slopes are found adjacent to the roadways. With increasingly severe and volatile rains patterns due to climate change, the risks of landslides have been exacerbated significantly.

Relative to the year 2000, the projected rise of global mean sea level (GMSL) by the end of this century is 1.0 to 4.3 ft(0.3 to 1.3 m) with a very likely (90 to 100% confidence) to rise 0.3 to 0.6 ft (0.09 to 0.18 m) by 2030, 0.5 to 1.2 ft (0.15 to 0.36 m) by 2050, and 1.0 to 4.3 ft (0.3 to 1.3 m) by 2100. High tide flooding will arrive decades ahead of any GMSL rise scenario. Based on the location of the Honolulu Tide Station, high tide flooding will occur by mid-century, and as early as 2028, at least two dozen times per year, at certain locations in the 3.2 SLR-XA. This is a dangerous elevation range, where reacting after the fact to establish adaptation strategies is likely to be less successful and costlier than taking proactive measures. Rising seas threaten human communities and natural ecosystems in multiple ways. Urbanized coastal areas become increasingly vulnerable to four types of flooding during high water and high wave events:Flooding across the shoreline due to wave run-up;Saltwater intrusion of engineered drainage systems;Groundwater inundation and;Intrusion of buried infrastructure and other buried assets that are not sealed.Modeling of sea level rise impacts on Oahu (Report) reveals the following:Homes and businesses on Oahu’s shorelines will be severely impacted by sea level rise;Nearly 4,000 structures will be chronically flooded with 3.2 ft (~1 m) of sea level rise;Of the 9,400 acres of land located within the 3.2SLR-XA, over half is designated for urban land uses, making Oahu the most vulnerable of all the islands;With 3.2 ft (~1 m) of sea level rise, almost 18 mi (30 km) of Oahu’s coastal roads will become impassable, jeopardizing access to and from many communities;Oahu has lost more than 5 mi (8 km) of beaches to coastal erosion fronting seawalls and other shoreline armoring and;Many more miles of beach will be lost with sea level rise if widespread armoring is allowed. A more detailed economic loss analysis is needed of Oahu’s critical infrastructure, including harbor facilities, airport facilities, sewage treatment plants, and roads.

During winter, Ulaanbaatar it's the coldest capital in the world, having an average in January of -24.5 °C. The minimum temperature at night drops easily below -35 °C; in January 2012, it dropped below -40 °C  for a consecutive week, with a low of -44 °C , while in January 2001, it reached -45 °C. In April and October, the daily average is around 0 °C. In May and September, lows are around freezing 0 °C  and highs around 15 °C, but given the climatic variability, sometimes, there can be intense frosts even in these months. During winter, snowfalls occur frequently, but they are light. The sky is often clear, although in the coldest hours, mists may form. The daily minimum temperature and cold waves has increased since 1980s in Ulaanbaatar. When air temperature decreases below–30ºC the road in Ulaanbaatar freezes and causes increase of maintenance.

Increased winter rains combined with milder winters when the ground remains without frost for longer times will lead to increased nutrient runoff into water bodies. This in turn will lead to eutrophication of water bodies and potentially also an increased need for dredging. Dredging in the River Aura was seen as particularly problematic due to poisonous harmful substances absorbed in the sediment and management of dredging waste. River erosion and failure of riverbanks were also identified as a problem caused by increased winter rains. These were considered to cause potential damage to streets, bridges and buildings located in the immediate vicinity of the riverbank. In the summer, rains are estimated to decrease and dry periods are expected to increase. The change may result in an increased need for irrigation in the Turku area. Increased draught was also identified as a potential threat for rock meadows typical of nature in Turku.

La inundación de 1998 también fue de importancia alta, debido a las afectaciones ocasionadas. De igual forma, el municipio ha sufrido las consecuencias de las sequías, entre las más intensas destacan las de los años de 1980 y 1981. La presentación de intensas lluvias es el principal riesgo que enfrenta el municipio, generando impactos significativos como lo son las inundaciones, desbordamiento y afectaciones en las infraestructuras. Posicionándose en los escenarios del cambio climático, los fenómenos que representan mayor riesgo para León son los derivados de las precipitaciones, lo que genera inundaciones y por lo tanto la generación de condiciones insalubres para la población, en segundo lugar se presentan las sequías por las temperaturas extremas que se han alcanzado en los últimos años y por ultimo los problemas a la salud derivado de los dos fenómenos anteriores.Respecto a las bajas temperaturas, las afectaciones a la salud, representan el efecto más potencial para la población del municipio.

Currently, due to unsustainable management, the aquifers located along the coastal zone are in a state of over-exploitation, besides presenting saline intrusion problems. This has impacted reducing agricultural, livestock and forestry activities; thus, local government has enforced temporary prohibitions of water extraction in certain areas and rationed water supply. Currently, a portion of the water available in the urban area is brought through an aqueduct that transfers water from the El Novillo Dam, in the municipality of Soyopa, 150 kilometres away from the population centre of Hermosillo.

This favourable change stems from entomological control actions, education, fumigation and the identification of mosquito hatcheries in homes. Other remarkable vector-borne diseases include zika and chikungunya, which also are spread by mosquitoes and rickettsia (transmitted by ticks); said diseases proliferate during the rainy season of summer, when water accumulates and does not infiltrate (allowing the incubation of the transmission vectors).

Besides social distancing, the plan includes restrictions on mobility and special regulations for hospitals, the industry & commerce. The local government has taken complimentary actions to mitigate COVID-19 contagion as well as the economic impacts of the pandemic. These include discounts in municipal property tax and water service, the promotion of individual sustainable mobility (such as cycling, and the design of emerging cycle paths), free COVID-19 rapid testing, food support for people in vulnerability conditions and the inspection & certification of commerce in anti COVID-19 sanitary measures compliance for their reopening.According to the figures published by the Citizen Committee of Public Safety in Hermosillo, domestic violence has increased more than 1000% from April to May 2020 (during the COVID-19 lockdown). The Secretariat of Security and Civilian Protection is providing personalized attention in cases of domestic violence through the 911 emergency number.

For the year 2009 Arequipa had 111, 179 vehicular units, and from 2010 to 2016 these increased by more than 150, 000 units, which means that each year they increase by more than 21,000 units (SUNARP 2016). Then, this excessive increase in the demand for vehicles, the result of no restrictions, planning and lack of government policies, as a result is the alarming increase of the vehicle fleet in the city of Arequipa, a situation that causes multiple problems in society. In the city of Arequipa, the Executive Directorate of Environmental Health (DESA) of the Regional Health Management, is the one that performs the monitoring and information of air quality, in compliance with the air quality regulations. The results of these measurements and data obtained on the presence of pollutants in different critical areas of our atmospheric basin, and the impact of air quality on health are periodically delivered.In 2017, the Environmental Quality Standards (ECA) for air are approved, according to Supreme Decree No. 003 - 2017 - MINAM, where the permissible limit for different pollutant gases is the average concentration of particulate material from 2013 to in 2017, it exceeds the standards of environmental air quality. The records on average range between 115.37, 76.78, 71.28, 71.76 and 111.77 μg / m3. This indicates that it is higher than what is allowed (50 μg / m3) and as a result will cause serious damage to public health (DIGESA, 2017)Average concentration of sulfur dioxide, concentration of ozone and nitrogen dioxide, from 2013 to 2017 do not exceed the environmental quality standards for air in the city of Arequipa.According to the Regional Health Management of Arequipa, it is estimated that the increase in respiratory diseases, irritations of the respiratory system, headaches, inflammation of the throat, allergies, affects the ability to think, diminishes reflexes, will tend to occur in the future. affects the fetal growth of pregnant women, among others.

These were estimated based on the best fit copulation for the severity and duration characteristics of the droughts. According to Zubieta (2018), in the last decade, the study of extreme climatic events (causes and effects) has had a great attention of the scientific community in Andean regions such as the Bolivian Altiplano. However, the impacts of climate change are not fully studied in southern Peru, where large economic losses can occur. As an example, we can mention the already documented cases of droughts of the years 1982-1983 and 1988-1989, which produced losses in US $ 216.5 million and around 430,000 victims.The phenomenon of drought has not occurred in the city of Arequipa since 1989, which means that in terms of management, the measures and actions that have been coordinated to face this phenomenon are insufficient, mainly due to the fact that the studies carried out have little scope to generate models of inter-institutional agreement in order to avoid isolated actions in the face of such an eventuality.

These lands have slopes of moderate to strong, and also devoid of vegetation, which generates mudflows in the rainy season and detachment from high intensity earthquakes.This type of events affects stretches of roads and roads, affecting bridges and homes in various locations in the city.According to the studies developed by the INGEMMET have been identified as critical areas: Cerro Quisco (Sabandia), Mosopuquio / Morocancha, Queuma Canuma (Characato), Miguel Grau - White City (Paucarpata), La Rinconada, El Mirador, Villa Alto Cenepa , Mariano Bustamante (Miraflores / Mariano Melgar) Left bank of the Chili River (Alto Selva Alegre and Cayma) Congata-Huayco Station (Uchumayo) Cerro Buenavista / Cerro San Pedro (Tiabaya) Carretera Arequipa-Cerro Verde / Larribure (Uchumayo), Arnao Bridge -Tahuantinsuyo (Miraflores).Given the geodynamic condition, where dangerous characteristics of mass, volcanic and seismic movements converge, with the recurrence in the historical period that have generated important damages in the population that in a disorderly manner and devoid of an adequate planning has settled in these zones the dangerous; this situation is expected to increase.

There is evidence of an increase in the frequency of extreme climatic events, as well as of the people affected by them, from 2003 to 2019 (INDECI, 2019).In 60 years the population increased from 100,000 people to 1,009,132 inhabitants (INEI, 2017). Both urban pressure, informality and lack of planning have resulted in the elimination or deterioration of areas with natural buffer ecosystems; and the deficit of green areas of the city that do not exceed 0.5 m2 / inhabitant (IMPLA, 2016), increases the risk of rain flood, due to the loss of soil absorption capacity.In the study Vulnerability and Adaptation to Climate Change in Metropolitan Arequipa (CAF, 2017), it identified the 8 existing torrent systems as one of the main hazards in the city. In 1997, the activation of the torrenteras caused the death of 6 people, 4,500 victims and an estimated economic loss of USD $ 2.3 million in the housing sector. In 2013: 6 deaths, 48,000 affected, 11,000 homes flooded, 5.5 km of roads and affected, damage to water systems, sewerage and electricity. Estimates of losses amounted to USD $ 102 million (UNDP, 2013a).The IMPLA within the city planning process identified zones of non-mitigable risk in the upper parts of the torrenteras. If we take into account the population settled in the marginal strips, banks and streams of the torrenteras, 2,415 homes are counted, which represents a total of 26,958 inhabitants in immediate risk in case of activation of the torrenteras.To address this problem, the following should be addressed:• There is no SAT There are only four meteorological stations, to cover an area of 38,327 hectares.• The incipient knowledge of ecosystem-based adaptation. There is ignorance about the ecosystem services and water regulation capacity of these streams.• Limited inclusion of climate change criteria in the planning and management of the City.

Se estima que el consumo de agua es de 360 l./habitante/día, muy superior a la media nacional, lo que refleja una escasa valoración de este indispensable recurso, así como una gran falta de conciencia por parte de la ciudadanía respecto de la importancia de su ahorro. Las corrientes de agua más sobresalientes son los ríos Chuvíscar y Sacramento, mismos que la contaminación y deforestación han degradado a niveles preocupantes. La zona de recarga acuífera del río Sacramento está deteriorándose rápidamente debido a la extracción de materiales pétreos para la construcción, la urbanización de áreas cercanas a la ribera y deterioro en general de su cauce. Las tres presas ubicadas en la zona urbana están en inminentes posibilidades de contaminación por instalaciones agropecuarias y por asentamientos humanos localizados aguas arriba del río Chuvíscar, sobre vertientes dirigidas a los vasos de las presas. Del agua que precipita sobre el territorio, prácticamente el 50 % escurre fuera de la cuenca por la Boquilla de Aldama, sólo un poco más del 3 % es el volumen máximo que se retiene en las presas, aproximadamente un 8 % se infiltra y llega al acuífero, y el 40 % restante se evapora o es absorbido por la vegetación y el suelo superficial. De primordial importancia resulta la construcción de infraestructura tanto urbana como rural, que favorezca la retención de las aguas pluviales y posibilite una mayor recarga de los acuíferos, actualmente sobre-explotados.

Antiguamente dicha recolección de aguas temporales no constituían ningún riesgo debido a su corta duración y a la alta tasa de infiltración de agua, en tiempos previos a la expansión de la mancha urbana.Con el crecimiento de la ciudad se realizaron obras de pavimentación que fueron afectando de forma paulatina la capacidad de infiltración de agua del terreno por lo que se fueron realizando obras hidráulicas que permitieran controlar el drenaje pluvial, no obstante, la expansión acelerada de la mancha urbana durante las últimas tres décadas ha acelerado e incrementado el nivel de riesgo de inundación, modificado las características y velocidad de los escurrimientos, provocando la degradación de la cuenca por sedimentaciones, escurrimientos y reducción a la capacidad de flujoEl sistema de drenaje pluvial actual, actualmente se satura por lo menos una vez al año en temporada de lluvias, las aguas pluviales anegan áreas hasta por 36 horas con tirantes de hasta 120 centímetros. Adicionalmente los procesos de subsidencia que ocurren en la ciudad, producen relieves cóncavos que rompen el sistema de drenaje sanitario y aumentan las posibilidades de inundación.En múltiples ocasiones, se ha visto rebasada la capacidad de la infraestructura pluvial instalada, presentándose desbordamiento de ríos, presas, bordos y drenes pluviales, generando graves afectaciones a la población.De continuar la expansión de la mancha urbana, se espera que el riesgo climático derivado de precipitaciones extremas sea mayor, generando pérdidas materiales y humanas, por lo cual resulta prioritario contar con un instrumento con una visión integral que articule de forma transversal el ordenamiento territorial y urbano con la gestión y desarrollo de la infraestructura pluvial.

Em maio/2010 ocorreu uma forte ressaca que erodiu boa parte da praia da Armação do Pântano do Sul, no sul da ilha. Para evitar a continuidade foi feito um molhe, paralelo a costa. Ocorreu o mesmo na praia do Campeche, porém não foi feito molhe. A erosão marinha causou danos em diversas edificações, construídas regular ou irregularmente,sobre as dunas.

Mas muito tem se pensado nestas questões, e alguns projetos vem sendo desenvolvidos no momento, como: Bacia de Retenção e Controle de Sedimentos no Córrego Revellion; Revitalização das margens do Córrego Anhanduí; Diagnóstico Ambiental da Bacia do Córrego Bandeira; entre outros. Em 2019 foram debatidos na Câmara Municipal de Campo Grande os desafios da drenagem urbana no evento Painel Internacional Drenagem Urbana - desafios e oportunidades. O Painel Internacional integra as ações do Junho Verde e da Semana do Meio Ambiente, somando-se a eventos promovidos para debater essa temática e  com objetivo de integrar planejamento e ações da Política de Manejo e Águas Pluviais de Campo Grande.Em maio de 2019, foi instituído o  Grupo Técnico Especializado em Drenagem Urbana do Município de Campo Grande, com objetivo de subsidiar planos de ações do município relacionados ao sistema de drenagem urbana.

Vale ressaltar que no ano de 2018 o município não sofreu com epidemia, considerado o trabalho que vem desenvolvendo no combate ao descarte irregular de resíduos (lançamento de ecopontos) e no desenvolvimento da educação ambiental para população como um todo.Porém, em 2019 o número de notificações foi maior do que o total registrado nos anos de 2018 (2.616 notificações) e 2017 (3.190). Referente ao ano de 2020, até maio foram notificados 12.616 casos de dengue no município, com  7.606 casos confirmados e 5 óbitos confirmados. Foram notificados 80 casos de Zikavirus com 5 confirmações e 49 notificações de  Chikungunya, com 7 confirmações.

Essa seca, além de favorecer a dispersão das queimadas, ainda causam problemas de saúde (respiratório) na população.Quanto ao combate às queimadas, desde o ano de 2017 foi incluído ao Calendário do município o ""Agosto Alaranjado"", mês onde são priorizadas as discussões referentes ao tema. Visto isso, a Prefeitura Municipal de Campo Grande e o Comitê Municipal de Prevenção e Combate aos Incêndios Florestais e Urbanos desenvolvem a Campanha ""Diga NÃO às Queimadas Urbanas"", com o objetivo de promover a discussão e desenvolver ações junto a comunidade, otimizar a gestão, o monitoramento, a prevenção e o combate às queimadas no município de Campo Grande.Em 2018 o foco da Campanha teve como vertente ""Queimar é Crime"", onde foram realizadas ações de educação ambiental e fiscalização durante todo o mês de agosto, e parte de setembro, meses esses com maior incidência de focos de incêndio no município.  Em junho de 2019 iniciou-se a temática ""Onde tem queimada, não tem saúde"", como foco nas consequências das queimadas na saúde da população,  com base nas estatísticas de atendimentos médicos e número de denúncias no Município. Em agosto de 2020 iniciou-se a campanha "" Queimadas: sua consciência é a cura desse mal"", como foco na importância da denuncia ao órgão ambiental fiscalizador,  bem como  a conscientização da população em relação as doenças respiratórias, considerando ainda as consequências da pandemia do novo coronavírus."

A fumaça e a fuligem se espalham em extensas áreas comprometendo a qualidade do ar, principalmente, para pessoas que tem problemas ou fragilidades respiratórias. Sempre que queimadas são desencadeadas o Corpo de Bombeiros Militar se dirige para debelar o fogo, comprometendo o atendimento de outras ocorrências mais importantes, e que poderiam ser poupadas se as queimadas fossem menos frequentes e intensas.

Quando ocorrem inundações causadas por enchentes de rios, a cidade fica quase travada, além dos prejuízos decorrentes das inundações. O saneamento é comprometido por falta de fluxo das águas. Também, devido ao transbordamento sobre algumas pontes, os veículos tem de fazer grandes desvios e o trânsito acaba sendo saturado em algumas vias. A cidade possui muitas áreas de margem de rios ocupadas por comunidades carentes, que quando inundadas, as águas dos rios arrastam resíduos sólidos diversos que vão sendo transportados e obstruindo o curso dos rios intensificando a enchente, e obrigando a gestão de resíduos intensificar suas ações nesses trechos, comprometendo os demais serviços de limpeza urbana.

Coastal flooding will impact the city's economically and culturally important Halifax Harbour waterfront area (commercial and industrial areas), as well as a number of coastal communities and their infrastructure, private properties and commercial facilities linked to the coastal economy. Coastal flooding in Halifax Harbour could impact up to 92% of properties below the 5-metre contour in that area, including at least 2 of its primary wastewater treatment facilities - thereby potentially creating public health concerns. HRM has modeled coastal flood vulnerabilities along its entire 2,400 km coastline using a high-resolution DEM derived from newly acquired topographic and bathymetric LiDAR data.

Over the next century, increasing atmospheric GHG concentrations are expected to cause a variety of changes to local climate conditions, including sea level rise and storm surge in coastal areas, reduced mountain snow pack, increased riverine flooding throughout the County, and more frequent, higher temperatures (leading to extreme heat events and wildfires), particularly inland, decreasing air quality, and extended periods of drought. These effects of climate change are expected to negatively impact water and electricity demand and supplies in Clark County; decreasing air quality and extreme heat days will degrade public health; increasing wildfire risks; and contributing to the decline of the County’s agricultural industry. According to the National Climate Assessment the entire Southwest region, including Clark County, has been affected by climate change. Over the next century, weather patterns that are considered extreme today are expected to become the norm. One hundred-plus degree days will occur more frequently and droughts will last longer. Scientists predict the average temperature in region is expected to rise between 2.5 and 8 degrees Fahrenheit.  These higher temperatures will mean less water in Lake Mead. As a result, minerals in the lake will become more concentrated, making the water undrinkable and threatening native fish. Drier conditions will also make wildfires more frequent and intense.The specific probability of the extent and frequency climate change induced impacts is uncertain and depends on various climate modeling assumptions. While there is some uncertainty about the rate of climate of change and the severity and frequency of extreme weather events, the IPCC, in its Fifth Assessment of climate change (2014), concluded that: ""...warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950's, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia. The atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, sea level has risen, and the concentrations of greenhouse gases have increased...It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.

While floods can, and have occurred in almost every month of the year, the most damaging storms typically occur between July and September. Recent major events include:- Aug. 25, 2013 flash flooding on the Las Vegas Paiute Golf Resort caused millions of dollars in damage to three golf courses, only 18 of the 54 holes were spared from damage.- Sept. 9, 2014: Nearly five inches of rain over a two hour period resulted in two washes and a river overflowing. 139 homes were damaged and a large portion of I-15 was washed away and impaired accessibility to the Moapa River Indian Reservation. A major disaster declaration was proclaimed for the State of Nevada.- July 6, 2015: A thunderstorm brought heavy rain, hail and strong winds across the valley. One area of the valley received nearly an inch of rainfall within just 15 minutes, and 1 to 1.5 feet of rain was reported in the west valley. Firefighters performed 10 swift-water rescues and tended to stranded motorists. Approximately 800 Southern Nevada customers lost power.- April 9, 2016: Flash flood warnings were issued when 0.81 inch of rain was recorded at McCarran International Airport. The Nevada Highway Patrol responded to 127 crashes, mostly caused by hydroplaning. A total of 43 injuries and 77 cases of property damage were reported. In addition, the Clark County Fire Department also rescued seven people caught in the flooding.- August 4, 2017: Heavy flooding was trigged by afternoon thunderstorms that dropped a total of 0.47 inches of rain on the central valley over a six-hour period. Mount Charleston was hit the hardest, receiving 2.80 inches of rain in total that caused heavy flooding and debris to clutter roads. Along the Las Vegas Strip area, eight people were swept away by floodwaters in two areas. Seven of the eight people were  rescued and one body was later recovered. The desert southwest often experiences intense rainfall and subsequent flash floods. Floods can and have occurred in almost every month of the year, however, the most damaging storms typically occur between July and September, which has been designated as flash flood season. According to the Clark County Emergency Management Plan – Basic Plan, a severe flash flood will occur in the Las Vegas Metropolitan Statistical Area every 2 – 12 months.

The majority of these structures are flood detention basins that are built to protect residential neighborhoods. The County has two high-profile dams within its purview, Hoover Dam and Davis Dam. Hoover Dam is located about 36 miles southeast of Las Vegas, in the Black Canyon of the Colorado River. Davis Dam is located near the town of Laughlin, Nevada. Further downstream along the Colorado River in the state of Arizona, are the Parker Dam and its reservoir, Lake Havasu. In addition to these high-profile dams, several detention basins are scattered throughout Clark County to divert and contain seasonal flood waters. Mill ponds that serve to store large quantities of water from mining operations are also of significant concern. Breach of these structures could also present a threat to lives and property throughout the County. Many dams in Nevada suffer from poor design or encroachment of development into the potential floodplain below the dam. As a result, many dams fail to pass an Inflow Design Flood (IDF) inspection commensurate with their hazard potential and size. However, there is no record of dam failure for any dam located in or affecting Clark County.According to the Nevada Division of Water Resources (NDWR), there are 67 high-hazard structures in Clark County. A high-hazard designation does not reflect a dam’s condition, but rather its potential for destruction in the event of an actual failure. As for February 2017, NDWR stated that approximately 90 percent of the high-hazard dams in Nevada are in satisfactory condition, the highest rating state inspectors give. According to the United States (U.S.) Bureau of Reclamation, the risk of failure for the Hoover Dam is “very, very low.” Dam failure can result from numerous natural or human activities. Earthquakes, internal erosion, improper siting, structural and design flaws, or rising floodwaters can all result in the collapse or failure of a dam. A dam failure may also be a result of the age of the structure or inadequate spillway capacity. While it has been mentioned that a number of dams have failed to pass an IDF inspection, the State has taken an active role in remediating the deficient dams. As such, the probability of a future dam failure affecting Clark County is unknown.

Based on the Palmer Drought Severity Index which measures relative dryness or wetness, this 17- year drought is the largest and most persistent drought for the West on historical record. During this time, the Colorado River Basin experienced its lowest 16-year period of inflow in over 100 years of record keeping. Reservoir storage in the Colorado River system declined from nearly full to about half of capacity during this timeframe. In January 2014, the U.S. Department of Agriculture designated nine Nevada counties, including Clark County, as primary natural disaster areas due to the drought. For perspective on the severity of this drought, the U.S. Drought Monitor sets the standards for the location and intensity of droughts. These standards include four levels of droughts, ranging from D1 (abnormally dry) to D4 (exceptional drought). From 2000-2016, Clark County experienced D3-D4 “extreme” drought conditions over five periods in 2003, 2004, 2007, 2014, and 2015. According to climate scientists, there is an 80 to 90 percent chance of another 10-plus year drought occurring this century, with a realistic threat of an epic 30- to 40-year dry spell or “mega-drought.”

Springs, and Trout Canyon. High wildfire hazard communities include: Cold Creek, Nelson, and Torino Ranch. Recent large wildfires in Clark County include:- July 2013: The Carpenter 1 Fire was a large wildfire on Mount Charleston, 25 miles northwest of Las Vegas. The fire began on July 1, 2013 near Pahrump (Nye County) before spreading eastward. The Carpenter 1 Fire was fully contained on August 18, 2013. It consumed nearly 28,000 acres and destroyed six buildings. According to the National Interagency Fire Center, the Carpenter 1 Fire was considered ""the highest ranked priority fire in the nation"" at the time of its occurrence.- July 2017: The Mount Potosi Fire was a large wildfire in the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest’s Spring Mountains National Recreation Area, about 6 miles southwest of Mountain Springs and 28 miles southwest of Las Vegas. It began on July 6 due to lightning. It burned roughly 420 acres before it was contained one week later. The Nevada Community Wildfire Risk/Hazard Assessment Project (2004-2005) developed a hazard rating point system of low through extreme fire hazards based on the scoring system. Five primary factors that affect potential fire hazard were assessed: community design, construction materials, defensible space, availability and capability of fire suppression resources, and physical conditions such as fuel loading and topography. In Clark County, there are four extreme wildfire hazard communities and three high wildfire hazard communities. Based on historical events, multiple wildfires are expected to burn within Clark County each year. However, large wildfires (i.e., fires greater than 200 acres) tend to occur every few years."

Monitoring showed that the center of the valley (near downtown Las Vegas) had subsided as much as 3.4 feet by 1963. From 1963-1987, the downtown area sunk another 2.8 feet, with nearby areas subsiding more than 5 feet. Fissures have been observed in the Las Vegas Valley since 1925.Additionally, Nevada is the third most seismically active state in the United States. The Las Vegas basin experiences shaking due to distant earthquakes in western/northern Nevada, California, or Utah. Earthquakes in  Nevada and Utah ranging from M5.0 to 6.0 were widely felt throughout the basin in 1902, 1916, and 1966. More recently, the 1992 Landers earthquake (M7.3) and the 1999 Hector mine earthquake (M7.1), which occurred more than 100 miles away, were felt strongly throughout the valley. The Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) values in Clark County for the two percent probability of exceedance in 50 years falls within the strong to severe ranges of the scale. Based on historic activity and PGA values, all areas in Clark County will feel shaking from an earthquake.The greatest subsidence hazard is the occurrence and continued growth of earth fissures. Valleywide and localized subsidence bowls are triggering vertical and horizontal differential movements on the numerous Quaternary faults occurring throughout the valley, resulting in the formation of fissures. Once initiated as small tension cracks, fissures willcontinue to grow as erosional features even if subsidence is arrested, and the impact on structures will increase with time if the fissures are not detected and remedial action taken. In the Las Vegas Valley, enlarged fissures range up to 10 feetin width and 13 feet in visible depth.In the Las Vegas Valley, Seismologists say there is a roughly 1 in 10 chance that an M 6.0 earthquake — one large enough to cause significant damage — will strike the valley in the next 50 years.  Land subsidence and the creation of fissures will also continue to occur in Las Vegas Valley as long as the net annual groundwater withdrawal continues to exceed the net annual recharge. Even if the region can reduce the net annual groundwater withdrawal to the level of net annual recharge, subsidence may continue for years after equilibrium is achieved because of a lag in sediment response.

In addition, the spread of infectious diseases and the probability of their occurrence are affected by factors, such as environmental changes, human behavior and demographics, and technological advancement. People who have weak immune systems are particularly vulnerable to infectious diseases. Infectious diseases can seriously affect those individuals who are infected with HIV or are receivingimmunosuppressive therapy for cancer or organ transplants. Others who may be disproportionately affected by infectious diseases include the elderly; persons being cared for in institutional settings (such as hospitals and nursing homes); and persons with inadequate access to healthcare, such as the homeless, and others of low socioeconomic status. In addition, pregnant women and people who care for small children are generally at higher risk for acquiring infectious diseases. The probability and magnitude of an infectious disease occurrence is difficult to evaluate due to the wide variation in disease characteristics, such as rate of spread, morbidity and mortality, detection and response time, and the availability of vaccines and other forms of prevention. A review of the historical record indicates that disease related disasters do occur in humans with some regularity and varying degrees of severity. There is growing concern, however, about emerging infectious diseases. Infectious diseases constitute a significant risk to the population of Clark County. Minor outbreaks occur an estimated 30 times per year. The probability of a major infectious disease outbreak, with the potential of reaching the scale of an epidemic, however, is not nearly as common. Based upon past history, a major infectious disease outbreak occurs about once every 10 years.

Pests enter Clark County on commercial shipments of plants, food, and other materials. They may also be transported on vehicles, fruits, plants, seeds, or animals when travelers enter the County. The following infestations have occurred within Clark County:Noxious Weeds: Of 47 noxious weeds listed by the State of Nevada, 13 are found in Clark County. Most of them do not have an overwhelming presence.Cheatgrass and Red Brome: These plants have thrived and cover about 9 million acres of land - about 13 percent of the state’s total acreage. Without human intervention, their populations will continue to grow.Africanized Honey Bees (AHB): The Clark County Public Works Department notes that “the AHB is well established in Las Vegas.”  The number of hives or swarms found in Las Vegas in 1999 was about 1,000; before 1998, there had been no reports of hives or swarms. Estimates show that 75 percent of all bees in the valley are AHB.Banded Elm Bark Beetle (BEBB): The BEBB has invaded much of Nevada and the Western United States and the extent of its infestation continues to grow. Quagga Mussels: An aquatic species, their presence in Clark County has remained limited to bodies of water along the Colorado River. Since their introduction to Clark County, they have expanded to northern Nevada.Asian Clam: The presence of Asian Clams in the County has not extended beyond Lake Mead.New Zealand Mudsnail: The extent of the New Zealand Mudsnail appears to be confined to Lake Mead.The Aedes aegypti mosquito is the main type that spreads Zika, dengue, and other viruses. The invasive species that are present in Clark County will likely exist for years to come. Clark County has taken steps to reduce the extent of infestations through laws, regulations and planning, but it's unlikely these infestations will ever be eradicated. Due to the transient nature of the County’s invasive species, controls are even more difficult to regulate. Historically new invasive species appear on average every 10 years. However recent statistics show new infestations are occurring more frequently. In the last 20 years, four new invasive species have been introduced to Clark County. This is likely attributed to the more transient nature of the population, but also an increased ability to track/study invasive species

The city sprays areas with high rates of positive mosquitoes. West Nile can cause serious illness, permanent damage to the nervous system and death. Increased development and significant rain events will increase mosquito prevalence in the future. Other vectors will have extended range in the US, including tropical and sub-tropical mosquito species that carry diseases like Malaria, Dengue and Chikungunya. An increase in tickborne diseases is expected as the range for tick species grows. These diseases can cause birth defects and tend to be more severe in the elderly and those with chronic conditions. Marginalized groups may not receive warnings and critical alerts from the city. Unemployed persons are less likely to have health insurance and may not seek help when they are ill.

High water levels from annual king tides (AKTs), 100-year storm surge (storm surge), and sea level rise (SLR) may impact  operations. During combined wave and high tide events, protective structures such as breakwaters are less effective. Flooding has the potential to cause injury, loss of life, displacement, and increased mental health burden. Elderly people may be less able to evacuate and at higher risk.With 11 in. SLR (the projected high-range by 2030 and mid-range by 2050), the following is projected for Long Beach:•	1.3 million ft² of buildings, half residential and half commercial, are exposed to AKTs. 9.5 more million ft² of buildings are exposed to storm surge. Without adaptation, by 2100, up to 17 million ft² of buildings are exposed to AKTs.•	10 City facilities could be exposed to AKTs including 2 fire stations and a solid waste facility. 7 more buildings could be exposed to the storm surge including a fire station, a library, and a school. •	parts of 17 parks could have AKT flooding while five more could are exposed to storm surge. Without interventions (such as beach nourishment), parts of beaches could have complete loss with 24 in (2050 high-range). •	the estuarine wetlands associated with the Los Angeles River, the Port of Long Beach, the San Gabriel River, and Alamitos Bay are impacted. •	4 miles of road are exposed to AKTs. 45 more miles are exposed to storm surge. Without adaptation, up to 98 miles of road are exposed to AKT flooding by 2100. •	A Generating Station and one substation are exposed to AKTs. With storm surge, another Generating Station could be exposed. •	8 miles of transmission lines and one mile of natural gas mains are exposed to AKTs. •	18 storm drain outfalls may be exposed to AKTs. 5 more are exposed to storm surge, potentially blocking outfalls from discharging and backing water up the drainage system. •	1 stormwater pump station are exposed to AKTs. 6 more are exposed to storm surge.•	1 mile of storm drain carriers are exposed. 14 miles more are exposed to storm surge. 4 pump stations are exposed to storm surge and 220 feet of force main and 280 feet of sewer mains are also exposed. •	1 potable facility (an interconnection) and 1 mile of potable mains are exposed to AKTs. 25 miles more are exposed to storm surge."

Therefore, asset exposure to riverine flooding was assessed based on location within the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) 100 and 500- year riverine floodplains. The facilities, parks, beaches, wetlands, transportation assets, stormwater assets, wastewater assets, and potable water assets exposed to the FEMA 100-year storm is very similar to the 11 inches SLR + 100-year storm surge scenario described in Coastal Flooding. An increase in intense precipitation events could case increase flooding due to impacts on the stormwater system. For example, in January 2019, a storm flooded some Long Beach streets and pushed water levels up to sidewalks causing some damage and reducing mobility for residents. In the future, an intense rainfall event coupled with SLR or a high tide event, such as a King Tide, can cause more flooding which would in turn limit mobility for residents and increase risks of property damage.

The number of extreme heat days (over 95 ̊F) in Long Beach per year is projected to increase from an average of four in the baseline period (1980-2000) to 11-16 days by mid-century and 11-37 by end-of century, depending on the emissions scenario. Extreme heat events can increase heat-related, cardiovascular-related, and respiratory mortality, and increase hospital admission and emergency department visits. Environmental factors influence vulnerability including neighborhoods with high levels of impervious surfaces and limited green space, and housing units that lack air conditioning or household access to a vehicle. The amount of green space per 1,000 residents varies considerably across Long Beach with Central, West, and North Long Beach having a lowest amount. Approximately 275,000 residents of Long Beach live within high vulnerability areas.Buildings without air conditioning or with insufficient air conditioning could be uncomfortable and potentially unsafe for occupants during extreme heat events.  Buildings require additional energy for cooling and may result in higher electricity demand during extreme heat events. At the same time, electricity supply may be reduced due to reduced hydropower output and reduced transmission line and power plant efficiency. As a result, there is an increased risk of demand exceeding supply, which could result in area-wide brownouts or blackouts. In July 2015, thousands of Long Beach residents went without power for three days. Many buildings and residents were impacted negatively, especially residents with disabilities who need elevators for mobility or refrigerators for medications. A future electrical brownout or blackout may yield similar results.Parks and Open Spaces, particularly beaches, may experience increased visitation during extreme heat days, which could put stress on associated facilities such as parking and waste management. Also, risk of asphalt pavement softening increase when temperatures remain over 100 °F without cooling at night, especially in areas with high truck traffic. Asphalt pavement softening may result in damage. If electrical outages were caused due to area-wide brownouts, traffic signals and streetlights could be affected, temporarily disrupting traffic movement.

However, The 2017-18 drought season was one of the driest on record for Long Beach with just 3.65 inches of rain—more than 7 inches below average. These conditions killed a large amount of trees and vegetation in Long Beach, from which the city is still recovering.In the future, vegetation in Parks and Open Space may be impacted by drought, but parks are likely to remain operational. The use of additional irrigation and/or change of vegetation to heat and drought tolerant plants may reduce the impact of drought. The use of irrigation may not be preferred as water restrictions may be in place during a drought. The use of non-potable water for irrigation may be a preferred option. Parks and Open Spaces may experience loss of some species that are not able to tolerate drought.Under extreme conditions, building foundations may be affected if the ground shrinks. This is most likely to happen with expansive soils that contain a large percentage of silt or clay. Damage to buildings may include cracks in the structure and sloping floors. Also, under extreme conditions, paving materials may be affected if the ground shrinks. Damage to transportation assets may include cracks and warping of pavement. Subsidence due to the extraction of groundwater from an aquifer faster than it can be recharged can also damage transportation assets.Generation facilities are sensitive to the loss of cooling water supply. The loss of hydropower generation during a drought may result in a greater reliance on fossil fuel powered energy generation, such as the generating facilities located in Long Beach.Reduced water usage decreases flows into the wastewater system, increasing sewer cleaning needs and system corrosion.The provision of water services could be compromised due to reduced water supply. Conservation measures and the development of alternative water sources, such as recycled water for non-potable uses, can reduce the impact.Disrupted food and water supplies could result in hunger and malnutrition, particularly in low-income households, children, and the elderly.

At approximately 29C excess mortality begins to increase as ambient temperatures increase.  The total number of days where the City of Windsor was under a Heat Warning were 23 (2016), 12 (2017) and 22 (2018).  A Heat Warning is issued when the daytime high temperature is expected to be greater than or equal to 31C and a nighttime temperature greater than or equal to 21C or a humidex greater than 42.  Heat related health issues are not readily available in Ontario.  The Windsor-Essex County Health Unit is currently undertaking research to determine the impact from the extreme heat wave from 2018.

The City of Windsor experienced an intense and damaging thunderstorm.  Temperatures that day reached 31C and this particular storm produced wind gust of 67 km/hr wreaking havoc on trees through the City.  The City's Forestry department is responsible for leading the charge with the clean up of downed trees, limbs and debris after each storm event.  On a yearly basis, Forestry routinely allocates between 4 and 8 weeks per year, cleaning up damaged trees and limbs throughout the City.  However, this particular storm had a significant impact on the City owned trees along the public right-of-way and in City parks.  This storm had the largest negative impact on our trees and resources than all other previous storms recorded over the last 5 years.  In fact, this one storm generated twice as many service requests than all of August 2017 alone.  Forestry received 1,187 service requests for tree maintenance for this storm event.  For additional perspective, the intense windstorm that the region experienced on March 8th 2017 generated only 329 service requests and the 2016 tornado generated only 250.  This storm was widespread and damages to the City's trees were significant.  As a result, 130 required removal and 270 trees required tree trimming to restore their health.  This storm cost the City of Windsor over $250,000 in response costs.  A number of City maintained trails were also closed for a significant period of time while maintenance was completed.

For the last couple of years both Lake St.Clair and Lake Erie are above the long-term average.  The US Army Corps of Engineers also forecasts water levels for the area.  These projections show the probability that the water levels in Lake Erie and Lake St. Clair will be higher in 2019 than 2018.  This has occurred.  The Essex Region Conservation Authority issues flood messages for the region.  The number of flood messages for the region are as follows:Year/Flood Watch/Flood Warning2016/7/32017/11/42018/20/8In 2018, Severe flooding in Essex County (not within the City of Windsor boundary) resulted in ten homes being put under an Order to Remedy (not habitable until fixed) and five under an Order to Prohibit Use (not-habitable).  In May of 2019,  The City of Windsor has been providing sand bags to residents located in identifies vulnerable areas along Lake St. Claire and the Detroit River.  In June 2019, the Essex Region Conservation Authority issued a 'long-term' flood watch for all shoreline areas within Essex Region and Pelee Island.An additional consequence has been flooding of the City owned marina.  Due to continuing high water levels the marina has been closed for the 2019 season.  City Council has approved a budget of up to $3 million to replace the current docks with a floating dock system to address this concern.

This included losing our local population of very rare Pumpkin Ash.  Blue Ash populations (listed as Threatened), while showing some signs of resistance, have also been negatively affected.  The loss of Ash in our riparian areas have now become vulnerable as some of these areas are being dominated by other invasive species like Phragmites.  This has resulted in a loss of biodiversity in these areas/wetlands and their storm water retention capabilities have now been negatively affected.Ash trees also had a major role to play in the integrity of the City's Urban Forest.  A very popular shade tree, Ash were widely planted for their fast growing attributes and attractiveness.  The City lost 7,000 Ash trees along the public Right-of-Way and in City Parks at a removal and replacement costs of over $4 million dollars.  Ash once made up 10% of our Street Tree Inventory.  Oak Wilt has recently been found on Belle Isle in the Detroit River.  Rare and Endangered Black Oak/Pin Oak Savana are at risk (1,000 acres).  Natural areas typically consist of 10-20% Oak Species.  Shumard Oak which are listed as Special Concern are also at risk.  The City's street tree inventory consists of 3% Oak Trees.Asian Long Horned Beetle.  This destructive beetle prefers Maple, Poplar and Elm trees among a few others.  Maples comprise of approximately 18% of our street tree inventory alone (~12,500 trees).Bag Worm prefers Honeylocust, Maples and conifers.  Mild winters promote the survival of overwintering larvae in bags.  Hard cold winters will kill these off and help keep populations in check.  Due to mild winters these are increasing in numbers.

In many parts of Canada, including Windsor, we often have days with clean air followed by heavy smog, and then a return to clean air.  Hot sunny days in the summer may be accompanied by smog.  The intense summer sun causes chemical reactions among the pollutants that are already in the air, leading to the formation of ground-level ozone a major component of smog.In 2007, Windsor reported almost 40 smog days, this number has dropped considerably to 0 in 2013 and 2014.  2015, the measurements for air quality changed in Ontario with 1 Special Air Quality statement being issued in 2015 and 2016.  The question that remains is with increasing hot days and drier summers will this produce more poor air quality days or will technology improvements (i.e. cleaner electrical system, EV vehicles, etc.) keep air quality in the area steady.Because of Windsor's past concerns regarding Air Quality it continues to be a topic to monitor.

Para esta situação contribuem algumas ocupações desordenadas do município que constituem um constrangimento à capacidade de resposta do território à ocorrência de cheias e inundações, assim como o dimensionamento dos sistemas de drenagem que não tiveram capacidade de resposta para caudais gerados por alguns eventos de precipitação excessiva registados nos últimos 15 anos e que nos fazem prever a necessidade de ajustar as características dos sistemas de drenagem em solo urbano e as dificuldades que os mesmos poderão comportar no futuro face às condições climáticas projetadas, acarretando consequências cada vez mais relevantes. Contudo, considera-se que as disposições regulamentares e as orientações delineadas pelos instrumentos legais, atualmente em vigor são claras e suficientes para permitir travar a ocupação desadequada no domínio hídrico, proporcionando os meios legais para a defesa eficaz contra cheias em linhas de água e o respetivo enquadramento no ordenamento do território.

O município de Évora, com uma agricultura adaptada a baixa pluviosidade,  tradicionalmente desenvolvida por culturas de sequeiro onde o cultivo da terra sem irrigação recorre a técnicas de uso eficaz e eficiente da humidade do solo e da precipitação sazonal, torna este setor muito vulnerável à diminuição e a variação da distribuição da pluviosidade anual. Os espaços florestais, por seu lado, dominados por espécies autóctones como o sobro e o azinho, apesar de apresentarem uma maior resiliência ao clima, também revelaram a sua suscetibilidade a anos mais áridos, registando mais ocorrências e maiores áreas de povoamentos ardidos.

Os anos especialmente secos 2004/2005 e 2011/2012, são demonstrativos das consequências destes eventos climáticos, tendo existido a necessidade de despoletar medidas extraordinárias, mitigadoras das consequências da escassez de água registadas no setor agropecuário.Apesar dos efeitos provocados pelas secas periódicas estarem mitigados pela ligação das albufeiras da região ao Empreendimento de Fins Múltiplos de Alqueva (EFMA), os resultados combinados do aumento da temperatura, da redução de precipitação e concentração nos meses de inverno, geram incertezas quanto ao futuro e confirmam que o principal desafio que se coloca ao município, e a toda região sul do país, é a gestão dos recursos hídricos e consequentemente a adaptação dos setores dependentes. Perante estes factos, é de esperar que a conjugação destes fatores afete, até final do século XXI a disponibilidade, a distribuição, o escoamento das linhas de água e as reservas de água subterrâneas e superficiais, atingindo de forma transversal diversos setores dependentes dos recursos hídricos, designadamente agricultura, pecuária, energia e florestas e ainda ecossistemas, valores naturais do município e turismo. Associado a escassez de água o solo é um recurso especialmente suscetível às alterações climáticas. A crescente tendência para um ambiente mais árido acelera os processos de empobrecimento e aumentam a taxa de mineralização, comprometendo progressivamente as funções ambientais, ecológicas, sociais e económicas por ele suportadas.A atividade agrícola, tal como hoje a conhecemos, verá a sua vulnerabilidade aumentada perante este cenário tornando, inevitavelmente, este o primeiro setor a sofrer efeitos negativos que se manifestarão com certeza, em reduções de produtividade, variações interanuais de rendimentos e anos marcados por perdas, de parte ou totalidade, das produções características desta zona do país, como a vinha, olival, produções cerealíferas, pastagens de sequeiro e consequentemente da pecuária.

While the fire was human-caused, the drought-ridden forest amplified the extent and severity of the fire. As a result of this fire, Aspen experienced prolonged poor air quality and the near destruction of critical power and communication lines.  No lives were lost in the fire, but multiple single-family homes were destroyed. Furthermore, Aspen and Basalt's communities are deeply intertwined, so the fire caused immense emotional distress to both communities. In the future, the hazard of forest fires is a concern for Aspen, especially in drought years where the forests are more prone to catching fire and the rapid spread of fire. A forest fire in the immediate Aspen area would create poor air quality, affect energy and communication infrastructure, reduce biodiversity in the forests in the short term, reduce tourism in the Aspen area, increase the need for public firefighting operations, and increase the need for emergency medical services. All of these impacts combined could damage Aspen's environmental and public health while destabilizing the local economy and infrastructure.

Low precipitation years, particularly in the form of low snowfall, can result in decreased water availability. Decreased water availability in the Aspen area in the past has led to high-risk fire conditions in the forests, decreased tourism in the summer months, and water restrictions from the local water utility. Low-income households can be affected by water restrictions and increased water prices that attempt to mitigate the shortage. These impacts are expected to increase in intensity and frequency with climate change as yearly precipitation levels become more variable.

As temperatures rise on average, the Aspen area will become a more hospitable environment for insects like ticks and mosquitoes. As more tick species and mosquitoes are able to survive in the Aspen climate, and live longer throughout the summer season, incidences of Lyme disease, and other vector-borne illness such as West Nile Virus, are expected to rise.

A large reserve of water at high elevations stored as snow can melt rapidly during warm summers, which can produce voluminous and swift runoff conditions. There are many single- and multi-family buildings along the banks of the Roaring Fork River and flooding can adversely impact these properties. Additionally, river flooding and its associated swift conditions can adversely impact public safety and the need for emergency services. As a staple of Aspen's summer economy is rafting, people can be exposed to these dangerous conditions and put both themselves and emergency personnel at risk when the river becomes overpowering. In the future, Aspen can expect to experience the above impacts on a more intense and variable basis that is heavily impacted by heavy winter precipitation and warmer summer temperatures.

The increase in intensity can be attributed to significant, single-storm snowfall that burdened the snowpack and caused the failure of weak snow layers, thus triggering massive avalanches. While these avalanches don't tend to occur in heavily populated areas, they were destructive to the forest ecosystem and cleared away many old-growth forests, impacted water supply when avalanche debris entered and dammed major rivers and streams, and resulted in casualties of those skiing and recreating in the mountains. In the future, avalanches aren't expected to increase in frequency significantly, but Aspen can expect more intense avalanches that threaten public safety, increase the demand for emergency services, threaten water supply, possibly damage energy system infrastructure, decrease the overall health of the forests, and alter where and how the community decides to build infrastructure.

Aspen has experienced minor landslides in the pas that destroyed property, such as cars and buildings. As Aspen will experience more heavy rain events, more landslides that are more severe can be expected along the perimeter of the city where steep slopes can be found. Landslides are most likely to damage residential properties, but they can also impact ski resort and energy system infrastructure, which would impact tourism productivity and result in significant costs and repairs. More, and more severe, landslides will put public safety at risk and increase the need for emergency services in recovery situations. Landslides could also impact the water supply by damming rivers and damaging forest health through the destruction of densely forested areas.

Other high-altitude, mountain communities in Colorado have experienced pine beetle infestations in their forests that often decimate their pine populations. Aspen has never had a significant population of pine beetles, but warmer year-round temperatures and longer summers could result in pine beetles surviving in the Aspen climate and successfully burrowing into pine trees. Additionally, significant avalanche destruction of old growth forests creates an ecological opportunity for the pine beetle to enter, and thrive in, the Aspen ecosystem. As avalanches become more severe, Aspen is at an even greater risk of developing a pine beetle infestation. If the forests around Aspen experience pine beetle infestation, this will lead to a dry fuel supply and high fire risk, decreased tourism, public safety risks due to unstable trees,  and decreased biodiversity.

Added to this, almost every summer the city experiences several days of fire weather that can bring the bush to the point where the it will burn uncontrollably.While there have been many significant bushfires in the Hobart area, one fire event stands higher than all others- the Black Tuesday fires of February 7th 1967. Of the many fires burning on February 7th , two fires in particular impacted on Hobart- the Collinsvale fire that burned across the face of Mount Wellington and through Fern Tree, and the Limekiln Gully fire that burned through Lenah Valley, West Hobart, South Hobart and Mount Nelson.  Across the state, 62 lives were lost . Today, the city’s urban fringe is closely meshed with bushland in the steep valleys and ridges . Most of these areas were developed at a time when there were few planning controls to require bushfire risk consideration in the design, construction and management of homes and infrastructure. Most recently in 2018 fire in the Huon Valley caused significant air pollution in the City and disrupted local economies and service delivery across the region.  There is no doubt that at some point in the near future, a bushfire will once again burn through the edges of the city. The risk of bushfire cannot ever be completely removed but with careful thought, hard work and the cooperation of everyone involved, it can be reduced. To mitigate the risk the the City’s has developed a fuel reduction program that is part of a three-year strategy that began in 2018. The strategy includes extensive fire trail and firebreak upgrades, flora and fauna surveys as well as the protection of high value conservation areas prior to any planned burns. Key stakeholders are notified of plans for each year’s fuel reduction program once approved and the City of Hobart display them on their website

This gives residents little time to prepare. The placement of Hobart in the relatively short distance between Mount Wellington and the Derwent Estuary means that there a large number of watercourses running through the city. The steep slopes of Mount Wellington and the high rainfall nature of Tasmania means that there can be a considerable amount of water moving very quickly down Hobart’s watercourses. The urban layout of Hobart has resulted in many residences being built close to watercourses and the coast where they could potentially be impacted by flooding or storm surge. The City has modelled storm surge and flood prone areas in Hobart, including some sections of the Hobart Rivulet, New Town Rivulet and Sandy Bay Rivulet, to determine the level of risk of flooding during a storm surge. Riverine flooding associated with an East Coast Low Extreme Weather event resulting in extensive flooding through out the City in May 2018. this resulted in 13,000 residences losing power, flooding of Central Business District  properties, flooding of street resulting in cars being washed away. This caused significant economic and social impacts across the City  with some residences still uninhabitable to this day.

The historic downtown and waterfront neighborhoods are located in a floodplain and contain 24.3% of the Jersey City population. However, a majority of households that would have the most trouble recovering from flood-related impacts due to being economically disadvantaged or having members over 65  are located outside of the floodplain.

Urban areas like Jersey City are also subject to the urban heat island effect since man-made materials like concrete and asphalt tend to absorb heat and make temperatures hotter than adjacent areas that are less urbanized. Climate models predict that climate change could cause up to a 55% increase in summer heat-related mortality compared to the 1990s.  By 2050, around 70% of summers are anticipated to be hotter than the warmest summer to date.

Between 2015-2019, there were 5 mild to moderate drought events that each lasted for less than 4 months. In the future, droughts will become more frequent but not necessarily more severe. The shorter amount of time between droughts means that the water supply systems have less time to recover. This, combined with an expected population increase of 29% by 2040, means that the demand for water may strain existing systems.  Jersey City in particular gets its water supply from surface water, which is affected more quickly during a drought than groundwater supply. The entire city will be affected by the drought, but children, the elderly, and those with chronic conditions are especially vulnerable to the health effects caused by drought, like the increased risk of water-borne illnesses or drinking water shortages. Emergency services and commercial businesses that rely on water, like firefighting or landscaping businesses, may struggle with the lack of water. The surrounding environment, like parks or wetlands, may also be affected.

Average annual temperatures have increased by 3 degrees Fahrenheit in the past century. Because of this, it's likely that the winter season will get shorter over time and overall snow cover and sea ice extent will decrease. However, it is also possible that the intensity of individual winter storms may increase, and the warming of the lower atmosphere may cause ice storms to increase in frequency over time.  There's not much quantitative data right now that can help us predict how climate change will affect this hazard.  The entire population is exposed in some way by extreme winter conditions. The elderly are more vulnerable due to their increased risk of injuries and death from slips and falls on patches of ice. The homeless has no shelter from ice and snow. The low-income population may be living in housing with poor insulation, or struggle to pay for proper heating supply. Icy roads and heavy snow have the capacity to shut down the city's rail network and make the roads dangerous to drive on. If emergency services can't clear roads quickly, residents could be stranded. Stormy conditions could create difficulties for the ferries that travel to New York City.  Even after the winter weather event is over, road salt and the freeze-thaw cycle of frequent winter events can cause prolonged damage to vehicles, roads, and rail lines. Snow/ice melt that contains road salt or other ice-removal chemicals could contaminate local waterways and hinder plant growth.  In addition, snow/ice melt along with increased precipitation may lead to excess volumes of water flowing into nearby waterways. This could erode banks and disrupt nearby plants and animals.  Accumulations of snow and ice can knock down trees and take out power lines, which could leave parts of the city with no electricity. Without access to backup power, residents could have limited access to important alerts and emergency services.

One of the most notable incidents was Superstorm Sandy in 2012. Half the city lost power, patients had to be evacuated from the local medical center, many city buildings were also flooded. Currently, about 35% of the population, 34.4% of residential properties, and 38% of non-residential properties are at risk of being inundated by storm inundation. Most of the at-risk properties are located near the coastal boundaries of the city. New Jersey's average temperature has risen more quickly than the global average, and will probably experience more annual precipitation and rising sea levels. This could result in more frequent and severe hurricanes and increased depths of inundation during hurricane events.While the entire population is at risk of being affected by a hurricane, those who may have trouble evacuating are especially vulnerable. This includes seniors over 65 or people who experience mobility-related disabilities because they may need extra time or assistance during an evacuation. Low-income households who may not have the money for a hotel or flood damage repairs may experience extra difficulties in post-hurricane recovery. The transportation system is at risk of being paralyzed by downed trees and debris that blocks roads or rail lines. Storm inundation could make the transportation system unusuable, delaying emergency services and leaving residents stranded.  High winds can knock over trees and cut power lines, which would leave many households and businesses without electricity. Hurricanes also cause millions of dollars worth of property damage, especially to residential buildings or high-rise buildings, which typically aren't constructed to be as resilient to high-speed winds.

However, no injuries or fatalities were recorded.  New Jersey has been experiencing more frequent extreme precipitation events over the last 10 years. average precipitation and the frequency of extreme precipitation events are projected to increase. In addition, sea level along the New Jersey coast has risen twice as much as the global average since 1911. A large portion of land in Jersey City is covered in impermeable surfaces like asphalt and concrete, which can also increase the risk of flooding. As a result, the frequency and severity of flash floods may increase. Flash floods happen within 6 hours of the weather event that caused it, which means that emergency services have less time than usual to evacuate  people.  The entire population is at risk of being affected, but seniors over 65 or people with disabilities  are especially vulnerable because they may need extra time or assistance with evacuation. Low-income households might lack the money to evacuate or deal with the consequences of a flood event (home repairs, business interruption, etc.). Some may find the cost of rebuilding overwhelming and choose to move away permanently.  And since up to half of the buildings in Jersey City are located within a floodplain, people who live in less resilient housing face a long, hard road to rebuilding their property if they choose to do so. Since flash floods happen so quickly, communication delays caused by power outages or blocked roads that delay vehicles can waste precous evacuation time. And if emergency vehicles have trouble navigating, commercial and personal vehicles certainly have trouble navigating around blocked roads and flooded streets. In addition to the immediate health and safety needs of the public (ie. trapped under debris, stranded, etc), excess moisture left behind can cause mold to grow in buildings. Floodwaters can capture and spread pollutants like sewage, pesticides, and animal feces and contaminated food and water supplies.

In addition, the current COVID-19 has devastated the entire world.The impact of climate change is not very well understood right now.  On one hand, warmer habitats can increase the number of mosquitos or other disease-transmitting  animals. Diseases that travel by air spread faster and with little warning, leaving hospitals and public health officials very little time to respond. Many people who contract the disease early may die due to a lack of treatments or vaccines available. Hospitals may be so preoccupied with treating patients of that specific disease that routine preventive care and elective surgeries may be skipped or postponed. To prevent the spread of disease, travel may be restricted or banned outright. Cultural events, such as funeral services, may have to be changed or postponed in order to prevent the possible spread of the disease. Higher-income households who can afford to do so are moving to more suburban areas to  avoid contact with people who may be infected. Jersey City residents from low-income or unemployed households may suffer disproportionately because they may lack health insurance or means to pay insurance copays or out-of-pocket expenses.  Residents with certain chronic conditions may suffer from more severe symptoms than those that don't.  The systemic racism that leads to  inequitable outcomes for marginalized groups may be especially deadly in the case of a pandemic."

Summer time is traditionally a dry period for the region and while overall precipitation is expected to increase for the region due to the impacts of climate change, those precipitation events are concentrating into extreme rainfall events followed by extended periods of drought.  Longer droughts will have a significant impact on the regional agriculture and food production which are highly dependent on a steady supply of water.  Tourism will also be impacted as the rivers and the lakes of the region are a significant draw for tourism.

Temperatures are higher than previous decades and those temperatures peaks are lasting longer.   Northwest Arkansas is traditional a boundary zone for weather patterns between northern states and deep south states.  That boundary zone has shifted north and now Northwest Arkansas' weather patterns are more predominantly deep south weather patterns - long hot summers, mild winters.  Urban areas already suffering from the heat island effect will bear the brunt of these harsher heat events. Furthermore, as Fayetteville's population increases,  the need for built systems will also increase, which will  only intensify the heat island effect experienced by residents further.

Mild winters mean that tick populations and other insect populations are not reduced over the winter. In particular, ticks have a lengthened transmission season due to an earlier onset of warm temperatures in the spring and a later onset of cold and frost.  This also increases the spread of disease carried by ticks and other insects.  An example of this is lyme disease which is spreading in the region at an unprecedented speed..  Other insect populations, such as termites,  can impact infrastructure.   Increases in insect populations are also accompanied by potential increases in rodents and other pests.

Although the correlation between climate change and tornadoes is still unclear, it can be assumed that intensified, increased severe weather events are some of the effects.  Tornadoes can have a destructive impact on any area in a city. The City has always been on the edge of Tornado Alley but data shows an expansion of that tornado zone which now includes Northwest Arkansas.

In the last decade, more Americans died from extreme heat than from any other weather-related cause. Anticipated health impacts from climate change include increased rates of the following [37]: Heat-related illnesses such as heat exhaustion and stroke. Air quality-related respiratory illnesses such as asthma and allergies due to wildfire smoke, ozone, and increased allergen production. Extreme weather-related physical and mental health injuries. Some infectious diseases transmitted by food, water, and insects, such as West Nile Virus and fungal diseases.LAW and ORDERA recent study by an economist in Cambridge suggests that rising temperatures will lead to an increase in criminal activity in the United States [39]. The reason for this relationship is unknown—it may be that when temperatures are warmer, there are more opportunities to commit crime due to open windows and more potential victims who are outside and interacting with one another. Another theory is that temperature has a direct effect on human aggression; studies have found that subjects make more aggressive choices when they are in a hot room. Regardless of the cause, this relationship warrants careful consideration of how governments deploy police and other resources to combat future crime in the context of a changing climate.COMMUNITY and CULTUREBoth nighttime and daytime temperatures are excepted to increase and many homes in the Pacific Northwest do not have air conditioning. Warmer weather can interfere with sleep quality and duration which negatively affects  human energy levels, attention spans and moods. If daytime temperatures are also higher than normal, the effects are often compounded. People may tend to stay at home or in their neighborhoods rather than get out and attend community and cultural events.

Increasing	Increasing	High	Long-term (after 2050)	Tacoma has not experienced serious impacts related to SLR yet but has had erosion from a long history of wind storms and king tides. USGS is currently working on modelling future impacts of storms and run-up to couple with the recent updated SLR projections. According to that recent science, by 2080, there is a 95% probability of 1.1' SLR, 50% probability of 1.8' SLR and a 1% probability of 3.5' of SLR. In 2150, there is a 50% probability of 4.2' of SLR.Tacoma has over 33 miles of shoreline and several industrial businesses and a major port in its tide flats area. Coastal flooding or inundation will have serious impacts on  environmental, economic and social systems. There are some residences along the shoreline and many businesses that will be impacted. The tide flats is a major employment and transportation nexus, both locally and regionally. National railroad and highways pass though low lying areas. The regional sewage treatment plant (owned and operated by the City of Tacoma) is located on the Puyallup River, which is expected to have increased chances of flooding in the future. It flows into Commencement Bay where tide and sea level rise impacts can complicate the chances of flooding. All City residents and many in the County depend on the operation of the plant. A flood wall was built in 2010, before current local SLR projections were available, but should afford some level of protection for several years.

This can cause wash out of bridge abutments anderosion/scour damage on roads. There is potential for loss of life if motorists drive into moving water.However, public education campaigns have helped to educate citizens about not driving through movingwater. Building damage is generally limited to water in basements where rain is too intense for drainage systems and natural drainage to carry water away from the structure. In addition, when combinedstorm/sanitary sewer systems are overloaded, this can result in sewer back-up. Generally, flash-floodingis short in duration and government services and business operations are not impacted.Based on historical occurrences available from the City as well as NCDC, the City of Des Moines isparticularly vulnerable to flash flooding as there were 19 occurrences during the 17.3- year period. TheUnincorporated County had the next highest number of flash flooding occurrences with 14 during thesame 17.3-year period. The frequency of extreme precipitation events has increased, with the highest number of 2-inch rain eventsoccurring during the last decade

The areas adjacent tothese streams frequently sustain substantial flood damages. During the Great Flood of 1993, PolkCounty suffered more than $152,000,000 in flood damages, mostly in the Des Moines metropolitanarea. In addition, Des Moines was without water service for 19 days causing the closure of most of thebusinesses and industry in the City. More than 3,000 properties were inundated. In 2008, residentsand business were evacuated as flows exceeded the 1-percent-annual chance flood estimate. BirdlandLevee on the Des Moines River failed and inundated the area behind it.The Des Moines River has two USGS gauging stations within the City of Des Moines, the Des MoinesRiver at 2nd Avenue (Gauge No. 05482000) and the Des Moines River below Raccoon River (Gauge No.05485500). Significant floods occurred at the 2nd Avenue gauge in 1954 and 2008 which resulted in apeak discharge of 60,200 cfs and 47,300 cfs respectively. The gauge was not in service between 1961and 1997. The peak flows at the gauge on the Des Moines River below Raccoon River occurred in June1947, April 1960, July 1993, and June 2008. The peak discharges were 77,000 cfs, 68,900 cfs, 116,000cfs and 104,000 cfs respectfully.The total estimated future building value at risk for Des Moines  is $338 million. Estimated building losses are $67 million. This includes 1300 residential structures and population of approximately 3150 people.

These winds typically develop with strong pressuregradients and gusty frontal passages. The closer and stronger two systems are, (one high pressure,one low pressure) the stronger the pressure gradient, and therefore, the stronger the winds are.Objects such as trees, barns, outbuildings, high-profile vehicles, and power line/poles can be toppledor destroyed, and roofs, windows, and homes can be damaged as wind speeds increase. Downburstscan be particularly dangerous to aviation. High winds, often accompanying severe thunderstorms, can cause significant property and cropdamage, threaten public safety, and have adverse economic impacts as a result of business closuresand power loss. The damaging winds of thunderstorms include downbursts, microbursts, and straight-line winds. Straight-line winds are generally any thunderstorm wind that is not associated with rotation (i.e., isnot a tornado). It is these winds, which can exceed 100 mph, which represent the most common typeof severe weather and are responsible for most wind damage related to thunderstorms. Sincethunderstorms do not have narrow tracks like tornadoes, the associated wind damage can beextensive and affect entire (and multiple) countiesAccording to the NCDC database, there were 35 high wind events and 331 thunderstorm wind eventsfor a total of 362 events in Polk County between 1996 and April 2018. During this time period therewere no reported deaths, 46 injuries causing an estimated $74.6 million in damages. Recorded windgusts ranged from a high of 104 knots to a low of 36 knots.. When counting only events that occurred on different days, there were 249 separate events in this 22.3 year period. Most recently, just two weeks ago, The Des Moines metro experienced a large derecho event that left people throughout the metro without power for upwards of 7 days, caused significant damage to structures, trees and vehicles. Many roadways were left impassible for a number of hours or days while tree crews worked to remove damaged trees and limbs.According to NCDC, there were 249 separate events from 1996 to April 2018 (22.3 year period) in PolkCounty. Based on this data, an average of 11 high wind events occur in Polk County each year.  This number is likely to remain steady over the near term.

Iowa hasexperienced 1,517 tornadoes from 1980 through 2011 (32 year period) with 86 percent of them beingrated F0 and F1, 14 percent rated F2 through F5. Only one F5 rated tornadoes have occurred in Iowaduring this timeframe (Parkersburg in 2008). Since 1980, there have been on average 47 tornadoes peryear in Iowa. Most tornadoes occurred in May and June but can occur during any month. Also midafternoon until around sunset is the peak time of day for tornado activity. There have been 763 injuriesand 26 deaths attributable to tornadoes (source: National Weather Service, Iowa Tornado ClimatologyReport 1980-2011). According to statistics reported by the National Climatic Data Center, Polk County had 27 recordedtornado events from 1980 to April 2018. Of these, 1 was F4, 4 were F2, 10 were F1 and EF1, and 12 wereF0. These tornadoes caused no fatalities, a combined 99 injuries, over $13 million in property damages,and $97,500 in crop damages. The National Climatic Data Center reported 27 tornadoes in Polk County in a 34.3 year time period,which calculates to 78 percent chance of a tornado in any given year. Even if the analysis only takes intoconsideration the F1-F4 events, the number of tornadoes would be 15 in a 34.3 year time period whichequates to a 43 percent chance of a tornado in any given year.With the 64 NWS tornado warnings issued for Polk County from 1985 thru May 2013 there have been anaverage of two tornado warnings per year during this 27.4years of data.Therefore, it is a high probability that some portion of Polk County will experience tornado activityin any given year. The City of Des Moines would have the highest number of buildings impacted (266) and the third highestdollar losses with a 10% loss at $1.1 million.

According to the NWS from 1981-2010 for Des Moines, the winter high temperature normal is 33.6degrees (F), the winter low temperature normal is 17 degrees (F) and the annualaverage snowfall is 34.9 inches.From 1996 to April 2013, the National Climatic Data Center and NWS reports 11 blizzard events, 19heavy snow events, 15 winter storm events, 10 ice storm events, and three wind chill events for a total of58 winter events that impacted the planning area during this 17.3 year time- period. This translates to anaverage of three winter storm events each year. The total property damage for these 58 events was over$7 million.NOAA’s National Weather Service Des Moines Weather Forecast Office has issued 178 Advisory,Watch, and/or Warnings concerning winter weather phenomena between 2005 and May 2018, a fiveyear gain of 84 winter weather statements issued from May 2013-2018.According to NCDC, during the 17.3 year period from 1996 to April 2013, the planning area experienced58 total blizzards, winter storms, ice storms and extreme cold events. This translates to an annualprobability of approximately three blizzard, winter or ice storm events per year.

Some of the damages that resulted in the declarations werefrom windstorms that accompanied the severe weather. Lightning events from 1996 to April 2018, Polk County experienced 9 reported damaging lightningevents. During this 17.3 year time period there were no lightning-caused deaths and six lightning related injuries. Reported property damages were $957,000 mainly due to lightning-caused fires. The NCDC reports 443 hail events in Polk County between 1996 and April 2018 causing $13.8 million inproperty damages and $845,000 in crop damages. Resulting in annualized property damages of$618,181 and annualized crop damages of $38,409. Of these events, 192 included hail 0.75 inches indiameter and larger. When excluding events that were reported on the same day, there were 115 eventsduring this 22 year time period.The NCDC reports 453 thunderstorm wind events in Polk County between 1996 and April 2018causing $74.7 million in property damages, $2.1 million in crop damages, one fatality (on6/17/2014) and 44 injuries. This results in annualized property damages of $3.4 million andannualized crop damages of $97,090. When excluding events that were reported on the sameday, there were 108 events during this 22.3 year time period. NCDC-reported damaging lightning events occurred 9 times from 1996 to April 2013. Since lightningaccompanies thunderstorms, it can be assumed that lightning occurs more often than damages arereported. These rates of occurrence are expected to continue in the future.Based on NCDC data, there have been 93 separate hail events in a 17.3 year period, producing anaverage of 5.3 hail events each year in Polk County. When limiting the probability analysis to hailevents producing hail 1.75 inches and larger, there have been 28 separate events (separate days) ina 17.3 year period. Based on this history, the probability of a destructive hail event in any given yearis 61 percent, making the probability for damaging hail “highly likely” in any given year.

As a result, its climate is characterized by large ranges intemperature with cold winters and warm, humid summers (NOAA, 2015).Since the beginning of the 20th century, temperatures in Iowa have risen approximately 1°F. Temperatures in the 2000s have been higher than any other historical period with the exception of the 1930s “Dust Bowl” era. The warming is due to increases in nighttime minimum temperatures while daytime maximum temperatures have not changed. Increases in humidity may beone cause of this asymmetric warming between night and day. The year 2012 was the hottest onrecord with an average annual temperature of 52.1°F, 4.6°F above the long-term average. Thiswarming has been concentrated in the winter and spring while summers have not warmedsubstantially in the state, a feature characteristic of much of the Midwest (NOAA, 2015). According to information obtained from the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) and the NationalWeather Service in Des Moines, Iowa there have been 3 heat-related watches 8 heat- relatedwarnings and 26 heat-related advisories between 2005 and August 2013. The planning team identified 157 days that had temperatures above 100 degrees Fahrenheit sincerecords started being kept in 1870. In the past five decades (since 1978), Years when temperaturesexceeded 100 during an event were 1977, 1983, 1984 1987, 1988, 2003, 2012, 2013, and 2017. Thehighest recorded temperature in Des Moines, Iowa during this time period (Polk County) was 108degrees Fahrenheit which was reached in August 1983.  Based on historical data from the NWS COOP station at Des Moines, Iowa there were 59 extreme heatevents during June, July, and August during the 68 year period from 1950 to 2018. This translates to an86 percent chance probability of an extreme heat event occurring in the planning area in any given year.

Knox County, along with the rest of the State of Tennessee has transformed from an agricultural-based economy in the 40s and 50s to a more urban one. That transformation has been paralleled by the modernization of the community water systems. More water systems have become interconnected; and larger, more reliable sources are being utilized to support water systems.

However, when the conditions are right, these areas become vulnerable to wildfires. Also, in the last few decades, the risks associated with Knox County’s wildfire hazard have increased due to the increase in wildland/urban interface (areas where development occurs within or immediately adjacent to wildlands, near fire-prone trees, brush, and/or other vegetation), more and more structures and people are at risk. However, with the history of no fatalities or injuries and nostructural damage during the 2006-2010 reporting period, the potential magnitude/severity of impact is considered to be “negligible

Projections range up to a several-fold increase in area burned annually in the state; however, projections based on statistical models may become less accurate the more that temperatures and other climatic factors change. An increase in wildfires likely would lead to more destructive flooding, as burned areas are more susceptible to flooding and runoff of sedimentation and debris, as well as air quality hazards (The Colorado Local Resilience Project, 2015). Due to Lakewood's proximity to the mountains, this has significant implications regarding flooding and air quality.

Dry grassland adjacent to residential properties and the seasonal Diablo winds can result in large, rapidly-spreading fires that cause widespread damage to hillside properties. Researchers at UC Merced have projected future fire risk for the entire Bay Area by comparing existing fire risk to the predicted impacts of climate change on temperatures, seasonal precipitation, and vegetation. The research projects some locations in Central Alameda County to exhibit decreased fire risk. Generally, across the Bay Area there is fairly limited change in fire risk in the year 2050, with the greatest change in occurring between 2050 and 2085, especially in the high emission scenario. While there is no data available specifically for the City of Hayward, the city is located adjacent to areas of unchanged or lowered risk. However, the decreased availability of water due to frequent drought caused by climate change could impair Hayward’s ability to fight fires.Additionally, due to PG&E's role in Bay Area fires in the recent years, they have started to shut off power during times of high wind where the transmission of electricity and weather factors could spark a fire. The power shutoff roll outs effected some Hayward neighborhoods in 2019.

This caused $95 million in damages with an additional $21 million being spent on repairs to public infrastructure such as bridges and roads.  The event was so significant that the City initiated the Flood Reduction Master Plan in 2005.  The events during the flood have become a community-wide touchstone across generations of Peterboroughites, which has catapulted flood reduction as one of the top municipal priorities to mitigate. To prevent downtown flooding, the City has begun construction of the Bethune St Diversion Pipe in 2020 that will relieve Jackson Creek which bisects the downtown core to support flood control.

There have been multiple events of localized flooding from extreme rainfall over the last 20 years. Extreme rainfall events are projected to heighten for Peterborough due to increasing humid weather conditions in summer months and raising the likelihood that more acute flooding will impact the community in the future. To counteract this risk, the City has put in place measures to help prevent the risk of flooding through the promotion of low impact development (LID) for residential properties.  This initiative supports the naturalization of properties to absorb rain and retain the precipitation as long as possible before discharging it into receiving infrastructure. Along with rain gardens, rain barrels have also been encouraged to be adopted by residents to store rainfall as well as utilizing the rain for watering gardens and lawns. In addition to the LID, Green Up, a local community organization has been actively working towards depaving driveways, curbs, and dead-end roads with permeable materials to aid in absorbing rainfall.

Moreover, unseasonably cold in the fall and late spring is becoming more prevalent than the gradual cool down and warm up in the fall and spring. A weakening polar jet stream in the near future will exasperate this phenomenon and possibly disrupt agricultural yields and production. However, most Peterborough homes are capable of withstanding freezing conditions but the city's homeless population is most at risk. The City of Peterborough supports local agencies in ensuring that homeless individuals are especially housed during extreme periods of cold weather

In 2018, a significant summer heatwave occurred with multiple days of +30C and nighttime lows of +20C. This put added pressure on the electricity grid to power air conditioners as well as putting outside workers at added risks of heat-related illnesses. The City responded by extending cooling shelters hours to accommodate the city's homeless and at-risk populations without AC to cool down.

Increased duration/severity of heat waves has severe implications on public health, housing, and transportation. Outdoor workers (construction, landscaping, etc.) will be at increased risk to health problems such as heat-stroke or dehydration. Transportation will be affected because people will be much less likely to rely on alternate modes of transportation such as walking or biking. This will increase the number of single-passenger vehicles on the road. Housing will also be affected because it will be more expensive to keep residential areas cool in the warm summer months.  Homeowners/ renters who can't afford A/C will be especially at risk.

Accumulation during annual maximum of 5-day and 15-day rainfall is projected to increase, which is consistent with recent change. Heavy rain events have also become more frequent. During the past three decades, extreme rainfall events, with 3 or more inches of rain, are happening more than twice as often compared to the 1890-1984 average. These spurts of heavy rain will cause issues with water supply and sanitation because they increase the risk of pollution associated with surface runoff.  Food and agriculture  will also be affected because short-lived heavy rains aren't nearly as useful to crops as steady long-duration rains. This is because in heavy rain events the water isn't given time to infiltrate the soil adequately. Heavy rain also increases the incidence/severity of erosion in the field.

Severe winter weather events involving some type of precipitation (freezing rain, sleet, ice, or snow) have an average duration involving at least part of 2 calendar days. The longest winter precipitation event in recent years was an ice storm in December of 2007 which took place over 5 days. In terms of extreme cold, there was a period of cold and wind chills in January 2010 which lasted for 12 days. Increased severity of winter conditions certainly will cut down the number of people walking/biking as their primary means of transportation, and will expose those reliant on those forms of transportation to health issues such as frostbite. There will also be an increased demand on energy during these periods of extreme cold.

It drains over half the state of Missouri as it flows eastward to join the Mississippi River at St. Louis. Since Boone County is located less than 200 miles upstream from the mouth of this 2,540 mile river, it is obvious that flooding is a potential concern for the county. There are also numerous creeks throughout the county with year-round water flows draining into the Missouri River.

The most significant impacts associated with drought in Colorado are those related to water intensive activities such as agriculture, wildfire protection, municipal usage, commerce, tourism, recreation, and wildlife preservation. In the past 10 years, Boulder County suffered 23 impacts related to drought. Those impacts were felt in the following categories: agriculture (5), business & industry (1), fire (7), plants & wildlife (6), relief, response, & restrictions (11), society & public health (2), tourism & recreation (1), water supply & quality (8).   The City of Boulder relies primarily on snowpack for its water supply.  If Boulder County’s future climate warms as expected, snowpack could become a less reliable mechanism for water storage and could push the city into more severe drought restrictions.

Boulder is crossed by 15 major drainageways or creeks.  Its location at the base of the foothills of the Rocky Mountains makes it vulnerable to flash flooding that can occur with little or no warning. Of the 15 major drainageways, 100-year floodplain boundaries cover more than 15 percent of the lands inside the city limits. There is no comprehensive technical assessment of how climate change might affect flooding in Boulder County, but research summarized in the Climate Preparedness Plan indicates a trend toward less frequent, but more intense rain events. In that circumstance, rainy days would become less frequent, but if conditions are right for an extreme event, and more moisture is available in the atmosphere, then larger extreme events are possible. The 100-year flood of today might become a more frequent event in the future (i.e., a 50-year event), meaning that current design levels and regulatory practices might be less adequate in the future.

Information from the Colorado Department of Public Health (CDPHE) indicated that West Nile virus was first detected in Colorado in 2002. West Nile is associated with stagnant water and drought conditions. According to the Boulder County Health Department, Boulder County and the City of Boulder will continue to be at risk to West Nile virus. However, the severity of these viruses is expected to change from year to year, depending on variables such as weather patterns, the mosquito population, the bird population, and immunity in humans. The number of incidents of the disease have been declining since 2007.  According to the Boulder County Climate Change Preparedness Plan milder weather in the current “cold” seasons and warmer weather in the summer could make the county a more suitable habitat for new mosquito species, increasing the potential for additional cases of some mosquito-borne diseases that are already established in the county. At the same time, increases in the precipitation associated with extreme events could increase the habitat suitable for supporting mosquitoes. Drawing definitive conclusions about public health risk changes associated with vector-borne illnesses as a result of climate change are complicated by the need to also account for any associated changes in human behavior that would accompany the associated impacts to seasonal and daily weather conditions.

A fire along this wildland-urban interface can result in major losses of property and structures. Significant wildfires can also occur in heavily populated areas. Historically, Boulder County has experienced numerous wildfires dating back to June 29, 1916.  The threat of wildfire and potential losses are constantly increasing as human development and population increases and the wildland-urban interface expands. Due to the existing fuel loads, semiarid conditions, and continued development, the Boulder area continues to be at risk from wildfire.  Given that climate projections indicate continued advance in snowmelt timing and increasing summer temperatures, wildfire conditions across the West are likely to worsen in the future.

Current research shows that warming temperatures and increasing drought conditions are driving MPB populations upwards. Warmer temperatures favor beetle activity, increase the stress level for attacked tress, and speed the development of the beetle.  Warmer temperatures and drought conditions have been observed to increase the probability of MPB populations switching from endemic to incipient epidemic or epidemic population levels. The combination of these factors creates future climate conditions in Boulder County that are favorable to MPB populations to spread and become larger. If climatic conditions remain favorable for the incipient epidemic population, the MPB populations may spread rapidly across the landscape and become an epidemic population.Additionally, Boulder is affected by the Emerald Ash Borer. The original Colorado detection was in Boulder in September, 2013. In summer, 2016 it was detected in Longmont. All species of ash in Colorado are susceptible – both green and white ash. EAB has cost municipalities, property owners, nursery operators and forest products industries hundreds of millions of dollars.Ash will eventually die without pesticide treatment. Before deciding upon an EAB strategy for Boulder, Forestry staff researched available options and collaborated with multiple state and federal agencies, other city foresters and with leading EAB experts from across the U.S. and Canada. The Boulder EAB strategy includes the following response measures: Tree Planting, Pesticide Applications, Tree Removals, Biocontrols, Wood Utilization, and Urban Forest Strategic Plan.

Since 1900, the number of days per year with extreme rain has been increasing by 0.2 days per decade on average. However, most of that increase has occurred since 1990. Regional observations of heavy precipitation in the midwestern U.S. also show that not only are extreme events happening more frequently, but that higher rainfall totals are being measured within these events. Averaged across the Midwest, there has been a 42 percent increase in the amount of precipitation falling in the top 1 percent of events from 1958 to 2016 (USGCRP, 2017). This observed regional trend gives additional support for the validity of the results in Indiana.The assessment also predicts that the state will have wetter springs and winters. Frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events are expected to increase, although more research is needed in this area to better determine the details. This will possibly lead to more flash flooding. Preliminary analysis from IN CCIA scientists suggest a one-to-two day increase in the average number of days per year with extreme precipitation. This finding is consistent with other analyses conducted for the midwestern U.S. (Pryor et al., 2014). Additionally, across the Midwest, a twofold to threefold increase in the number of storm events exceeding a two-day five-year return period11 is projected by late century under the high emissions scenario, with one-day 20-year return period storms increasing by about 20 percent (USGCRP, 2017).https://ag.purdue.edu/indianaclimate/indiana-climate-report#precipitation

Winters and springs are likely to be much wetter by mid-century, while expected changes in summer and fall precipitation are less certain. Increased precipitation, especially in the form of heavy rain events, will increase flooding risks and pollute water as combined sewer systems overflow and fertilizers run off of farm fields. Warmer summers with the same or less rain would increase stress on agricultural crops and drinking water supplies.A White House report on the threat of carbon pollution in Indiana points to the year 2011, when 11 of the 14 weather-related disasters that cost more than $1 billion in the United States were in the Midwest. In 2008, floods killed 24 people and cost $8 billion in agricultural losses. (https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/docs/state-reports/climate/Indiana%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf)

These extreme cold events provide a natural control on the number and extent of some species of nuisance pests such as ticks and mosquitoes. As temperatures rise, these pests are better able to survive the winter, increase their populations and expand their ranges. This puts Indiana at risk for some invasive species and insect pests that historically would not survive Indiana’s coldest winter temperatures.On farms, cold winters help keep pests and pathogens in check. But warmer winters will allow pests to spread north and exacerbate disease pressures. U.S. corn producers spend more than $1 billion per year controlling pests, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists report. A study from Purdue University suggests that climate change and its effect on corn pests will substantially increase seed and insecticide costs for those growers and reduce crop yields.

This could result in a longer allergy season, with increased impacts for vulnerable populations. Common pollen allergies in Bloomington include tree, grass, and ragweed pollen. It was noted in 2018 by experts working at Allergy and Asthma of Southern Indiana that allergy season has been worse than previous years because of pollen. The reason being trees usually bloom and release pollen in stages around late February and early March. In 2018, the weather was too cold; it was still snowing in April. In May, every tree was still out there pollinating, such as oak, pine, maple, and every tree that pollinates in February was still playing catch-up in May. It is assumed that these trends were experienced in 2019 and will continue in upcoming years.Pollen is collected on the roof of IU Health Bloomington Hospital each morning and is then inspected underneath a microscope to estimate pollen counts. From June 4-5, Bloomington had the highest pollen counts in the nation. (https://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/post-tribune/ct-ptb-indiana-allergy-season-st-0704-story.html)

The longer and more severe wildfire season has increased resource demands on City firefighting staff. In the future, high-severity wildfires could have serious  implications:- immediate threats to public health from an active wildfire, including threats to health from fire, smoke, and evacuations.- a mass evacuation would have negative implications for the local community. In the event of an evacuation, those without homes, adequate transport, or with limited disposable income are at greater risk of negative consequences. Longer-term effects include economic losses for local businesses, loss of income for residents, and mental health effects.- More frequent, high-severity wildfires will also pose threats to buildings and infrastructure, potentially impairing the ability to render services to residents in the short and long term.- After fires, local watershed health may be greatly impacted, with long-term water quality impacts for both the natural environment and drinking water systems.- Post-wildfire flooding is an enormous and highly consequential threat, with the risk of losing lives, and a large portion of Flagstaff's downtown and the NAU campus are at risk of flooding if certain areas were to burn in a high-severity wildfire.- Even if the wildfire does not pose an immediate threat to Flagstaff residents, visitors and infrastructure, an increase in wildfires likely will increase demand on the City resources, to respond to wildfire events. Wildfires will cause increases in respiratory and other illnesses related to prevalence of smoke-filled air adversely affects community health.

Increases in erosion and under cutting of roads and structures poses additional threat to longevity of these structures. Floods of this nature also restrict and impede transportation flow, affecting accessibility for community and emergency services. Potential for increase in flood and storm related injury/mortality.Flooding in Flagstaff is linked to heavy monsoon rains in summer and early autumn, and long periods of low-intensity rain in the winter, especially following snowfall. Many of Flagstaff’s low- and moderate-income neighborhoods are partially or wholly within the 500-year floodplain and flood more often than other areas of the city.Wildfires also lead to substantial post-fire flooding because they dry out soil, reduce water absorption, and burn the trees and plants that hold soil in place. Even a normal rainstorm following a wildfire can wash large quantities of soil and water from fire-affected slopes and into waterways. Most post-fire flooding occurs in communities living near the forest edge. These floods may recur for several years while vegetation regrows on burned slopes. Flooding triggered by the 2010 Schultz Fire cost an $133-147 million and affected Doney Park, Timberline-Fernwood, and other communities up to four miles from the fire’s location. Flooding continued for four years after the fire, causing additional damage to property, utilities, and roads.The projection for more frequent wildfires suggests flooding after wildfires will also become more frequent. An estimated 8-10 percent of Flagstaff’s overall population and 6-10 percent of the over-65 population lived in medium- and high-hazard flooding areas in 2009, the most recent year for which this data is available. Additionally, damage to residential, commercial, and industrial buildings in medium- and high-hazard areas would cost millions of dollars. A wildfire and post-fire flooding in Dry Lake Hills or Mormon Mountain could cost Flagstaff $573 million to $1.2 billion.

This could result in economic losses for local businesses, tourism sector, and endanger lives as emergency services are also restricted. Flight cancellations as a result of extreme winter conditions would also adversely affect economic activity in the area.Health concerns related to cold temperatures are likely to decline as winter temperatures warm. By 2100, as few as 100 days each year are expected to fall below freezing, compared to an average of 197 days per year from 1950 to 2017. Winter heating costs may decline and partially offset the expected increase in summer cooling costs. For those experiencing homelessness, fewer consecutive cold days may reduce the risk of cold-related injuries and death if necessary services are available for the remaining cold days. However, those experiencing homelessness (including forest dwellers) remain among the most vulnerable to very hot and very cold days, which are projected for up to half the year by 2100 (130 to 180 days above 90°F or below 32°F).

Reduced snowpack in winter from drought conditions would affect water supplies during the year. Drought also can result in forest closures, which has mental health, physical health, recreational, social and economic impacts for the community.High vulnerability due to projected losses in suitable water supply and increasing population, despite proactive planning, use of reclaimed water, and successful water conservation to date. Flagstaff has pursued many strategies to secure a sustainable long-term water supply in the face of population growth and climate change. Even so, a water supply shortfall of 28 to 40 percent is expected when Flagstaff’s population exceeds 87,600.While the City’s progress in water efficiency and water conservation has postponed the need for a new water source, Flagstaff’s water supply remains susceptible to multiple risks as the climate changes:• Drought and increased temperatures: When surface water supply runs low, the city relies more on groundwater pumping. The average annual temperature is projected to increase 4-5°F by 2050, driven largely by an increase in minimum temperatures.• Wildfire: Currently just 20 percent of Flagstaff’s water can be sourced within city limits, and the entire city can be sustained with the water in the pipes and storage tanks for just under two days. Larger and more frequent wildfires may impair water quality from the forested watersheds that currently provide 80 percent of Flagstaff’s water supply. • Reduced snowpack: Average winter temperatures hover around 34.5°F in Flagstaff, and winter snowpack is an important source of aquifer recharge and surface water flows into Upper Lake Mary. However, with a 4°F increase in average winter temperature expected by 2050, more water will evaporate from the landscape than it does today and more precipitation will fall as rain rather than snow.• Change in the timing of rain and snow: Climate change has already led to fewer but more intense storms during the monsoon season. These trends may continue as temperatures warm further.

This will have a public health impact for populations sensitive and vulnerable to extreme heat. While extreme heat is not as common in Flagstaff as in southern Arizona, there are cases of heat-related illness and death. From 2005-2015, there were 18 deaths in Coconino County from exposure to excessive natural heat, and approximately 20 emergency department visits and hospital inpatient stays. Data are not available on how many of these cases occurred in Flagstaff or were treated there. However, as the largest city in the county, Flagstaff’s public health services may be called on more in the future to treat cases of extreme heat. By 2100, 30 to 80 days per year are expected to be above 90°F, compared to just 2 days per year between 1950 and 2017. This projected increase in days above 90°F could increase the risk of heat-related illness and death, especially for those who work outdoors, those who are experiencing homelessness, and households currently without air conditioning. Low-income households already struggling to afford basic needs could be particularly vulnerable to extreme heat without affordable options for air conditioning or refuge from extreme heat. The risk is further increased for emergency workers and first responders tasked with responding to summer wildfires.Hotter summers in southern Arizona and fewer snow-based recreation opportunities locally may shift someof Flagstaff’s recreation and tourism to the summer months and shoulder seasons (spring and fall).  National economicstudies suggest gains in warm-season tourism may compensate for losses in cold-season tourism. However, Flagstaff’s already-robust tourism infrastructure may need additional capacity to meet higher demand. With visitors concentrated in the warm season, unintended environmental stresses such as greater water demand or increased trampling of natural areas may also occur. Despite City efforts, housing costs are expected to continue to rise in Flagstaff as the population grows, Baby Boomers retire, and purchases of second homes increase. As temperatures increase in southern Arizona, and visitation or second homes to Flagstaff increase, housing pressures in Flagstaff may worsen.

Without intervention, rising sea levels may cause more frequent flooding, longer-duration flooding, erosion, overtopping and increased salinity intrusion. Sea level rise can cause shoreline protection, such as levees, berms and revetments, to be damaged or fail due to increased tidal and wave energy. Levee failure poses a great risk to life and property in areas where levees protect surrounding property from sea level rise, surge and flooding. The City has two primary levees. One is located along Alameda Creek protecting North Fremont and the other along Coyote Creek protecting the south Baylands area. If the levees were to fail then property adjacent to these areas would be susceptible to flooding and flood damage. As sea levels rise, groundwater and salinity levels are also predicted to rise, causing damage to below grade living spaces and electrical/mechanical equipment that is below or at-grade. In addition, increasing groundwater levels may increase liquefaction susceptibility, and require the use of pumping of stormwater for flood management, which will increase both operations and maintenance costs.Critical assets such as Railway, Storm Drains Structures/Lines, and Power Lines are labeled as high and medium impact and will be significantly impacted in the future. The permanent inundation of Railway, Storm Drains Structures/Lines, and Power Lines would significantly impact the City's ability to function, commute, and operate in a safe way.

Extreme heat days pose a public health threat, causing symptoms, such as, exhaustion, heat cramps, and sunstroke if the Heat Index is over 90 F.  Heat emergencies occur when residents are subject to heat exhaustion and heatstroke, and are more likely to occur in areas not adapted to heat and without air conditioning, cooling centers, or vegetation to mediate heat impacts in exposed areas. Certain populations are typically the most at risk during extreme heat emergencies, including people with disabilities, chronic diseases, the elderly, and children. Climate change is expected to generate an increase in ambient average air temperature, particularly in the summer. The frequency, intensity, and duration of extreme heat events and heat waves are also expected as regional climate impacts.The increase of extreme hot days will negatively impact our residents, especially our elderly residents and other vulnerable populations. Direct impacts of extreme heat include increases in heat-related illnesses such as heat-stroke, dehydration, and heat-related mortality such as heart disease. High temperatures can also exacerbate the impact of pre-existing conditions such as diabetes and renal disease. Higher temperatures and stagnant air also worsen Fremont's air quality and lead to higher rates of respiratory illness, asthma, and allergies. Indirect impacts of extreme heat include exacerbating behavioral health problems. The increase in heat-related hospitalizations and emergency room visits will strain the City’s health care infrastructure and affect care for all Fremont residents. Higher temperatures and increased duration of these high-temperature days will also lead to higher energy demands to cool homes and buildings, which will strain our resources and result in the use of highly polluting peaker plants to meet energy demands.

Wildland fires can cause damage to linear infrastructure systems that serve the Bay Area, causing outages downstream, can impact the air quality in cities during the duration of the fire, and can impact water quality in watersheds impacted by a wildland fire.  Wildland and wildland-urban interface fires can also damage natural environments, such as recreational areas, and can cause lasting impacts to slopes and soils. Wildfire risk increases due to climate change because of the experienced higher temperatures and longer dry periods, which result in longer fire seasons.  Additionally, wildfire risk will also be influenced by potential changes in vegetation. This lethal hazard has already been experienced on an alarming scale in neighboring communities and cities in California.

Climate change is likely to increase the number and severity of future droughts, resulting in drier conditions, and will alter the timing and efficiency of the Bay Area water supply. An increase in temperature and a reduction in snow pack are the two most direct effects of climate change that will result in a drier state with fewer natural water resources than historically have been available. Prolonged periods of drought can reduce water supply for regional crops and livestock feed; increased wildfire hazard; and subsidence. Fire hazard increases where drought conditions are high. Additionally, drought reduces the water supplies available to fight wildfires, leading to larger and more extended fires.   While drought does not have any primary impacts in the Bay Area, prolonged periods of drought can cause secondary impacts that can affect the region. Regional and statewide impacts include reduced water supply for urban water supply, crops and livestock feed; increased wildfire hazard; and subsidence. Drought is not localized, but occurs simultaneously across the region, and may extend statewide or across a larger expanse of western states. The impacts of the drought are locally unique, based on local water supply systems, soil conditions, and the typical climate and vegetation land covering. The effects of drought are managed in the Bay Area through the importation of water and the storage of water in reservoirs.The reduction in snowpack does not have direct impacts on Fremont, since there is rarely accumulation of snow. Shortages in precipitation in the Sierra Nevada can have a more pronounced impact on water supply in the region than a drought in the Bay Area itself because of the reliance of the region on water from the Sierra’s. Currently, Alameda County Water District receives 40% of the water from the State Water Project; 20% from San Francisco Public Utilities Commission; and 40% from Alameda Creek Watershed Runoff. That means that over 60% of the water is imported to Fremont from beyond the Bay Area. Climate change will have an impact since snowfall accumulation will decrease in the winter. Snow that accumulates will melt earlier in the year with warmer weather throughout California.

If winters are compressed, with more rain falling in fewer months, or if individual years are more extreme, the chance of rainfall-induced landslide will increase. Additionally, if fires burn greater portions of landslide- vulnerable hillsides, removing vegetation and increasing storm runoff, the landslide probability will increase.

The rainfalldepth over a six-hour period in the areas around the Ngongotahā catchment reached 145 mm, with62.5 mm of rain falling in one hour. Rotorua streams, wastewater and stormwater systems wereoverwhelmed with the large volume of water that fell in that short period of time, with floodwatersflowing across roads and affecting numerous residential dwellings as well as commercial andindustrial properties.The Ngongotahā Stream reached its highest recorded level and overflowed its banks in severalplaces. While flooding occurred throughout the Rotorua district, the Ngongotahā catchmentexperience was extreme and resulted in floodwaters inundating many homes and severalbusinesses. Approximately 100 houses were declared insanitary and required extensive repair work, somebusinesses were closed for days while they undertook repairs, and Rotorua Lakes Council (RLC)faced roading and other infrastructure repairs.Emergency services were activated on the morning of 29 April 2018 and the RLC Mayor, SteveChadwick, declared a State of Emergency at 17.25 hours on that day, which remained in place until6 May 2018. Indications were that this was a 100-year flood event in the Ngongotahā catchmentand possibly more extreme than in some other parts of Rotorua. By December 20018, there were still 22 insanitary notices in place on homes.As a response to the flood and the impact it had on Ngongotahā and the wider district, RLC, inconjunction with the Bay of Plenty Regional Council (BOPRC), commissioned an independent Panelto investigate the events of 29 April 2018 and to make recommendations intended to reduce theimpact of severe flood events in the future. The anticipated increase in heavy rainfall events is likely to mean an increase in surface flooding events.As part of Council's planning for climate change, stormwater systems and management are a major focus.

The anticipated increase in more extreme climate events could mean an increase in subsidence events. Longer periods of heavy rain, combined with longer periods of dry, summer weather can cause constant fluctuations in groundwater which makes the soil unstable. Properties built in drought-prone areas could become more vulnerable to subsidence, as could properties built in areas prone to flooding.

Some cyanobacteria species are known to produce toxins. Testing programmes are in place by public health authorities, resulting in notices to avoid contact by humans and animals when algae is blooming. Scientists predict that climate change will have many effects on freshwater and marine environments.  These effects, along with nutrient pollution, might cause harmful algal blooms to occur more often, in more waterbodies and to be more intense.  A warming climate is also expected to affect the infection rates of Cryptosporidium, a microscopic parasite transmitted mainly through water. Cryptosporidiosis rates can increase during extreme droughts, when reduced river flows and water levels increase the concentration of contaminants. Periods of heavy rainfall can also increase the number of Cryptosporidiosis cases, when overflowing sewage systems may discharge untreated sewage into waterways, or effluent run-off can increase the concentration of microbes in the water.

Quezon City was one of the most affected areas in terms of flooding, with the highest height of flood ranging from neck level up to rooftop. 107,000 persons were reported to be displaced in Quezon City.From 1948 to 2019, 18 tropical cyclones crossed Metro Manila, of which 12 typhoons.Extreme rainfall events can occur significantly more often through climate change. These events will cause more flooding. As warmer air can hold more water vapor, the risks are increasing in a warmer world. Also, since this increases humidity, there is a feedback loop to the anticipated heat stress.Future projections by PAGASA show that there is no discernible increase in the frequency of tropical cyclones. However, increases in the intensity of cyclones have been experienced in recent years that are attributed to the rising sea surface temperature. It is expected that the projected continuous warming in the future could further enhance the intensity of typhoons and exacerbate its damaging effects.Projections for seasonal change in rainfall towards 2050 show opposite trends: wet areas will probably have more rainfall, while dry areas have less.The following are the expected impacts of the hazard in the future for Quezon City:1. Very high level of displacement and loss of lives because of storms and floods. It is estimated that a 100-year flood will result in 111 casualties in Quezon City, with floods also leading to accidents and injuries like contusions, fractures and electrocution.2. Very high level of post-flood disease outbreaks. Extreme rainfall and the resulting floods may lead to increase transmission of infectious diseases. Systematic failures of healthcare systems could lead to increase fatalities.3. High level of threatened access to safe drinking water after flooding. After flood many people in Quezon City do no have access to safe drinking water, especially the urban poor.4. Medium level of threatened food security.  Excessive rainfall could inflict serious damages to agricultural crops. After extreme rainfall, access to food can be limited which could also influence the general condition of the population, including malnutrition and the lack of adequate immunity.5.

Long dry periods can have a serious impact on the availability of water. In 2019, data from PAGASA showed La Mesa dam at a critical level of less than 70 meters, the lowest in 12 years. Low water levels may result in water interruption schedules, leading to barangays experiencing low water pressure to no water at all throughout the summer.Future projections from PAGASA show opposite trends for rainfall towards 2050: wet areas will probably have more rainfall, while dry areas have less. The length of the longest dry spell, which is the maximum number of consecutive dry days with daily precipitation under 1 mm, is projected to increase with 7.5 days towards 2050.Water stress is an indicator of competition for water resources: an increase in water stress indicates more competition among users, hitting the urban poor the hardest. For Quezon City, the World Resources Institute indicates that the current low/medium level of water stress will worsen to an extremely high level in 2040.The following are the expected impacts of the hazard in the future for Quezon City:1. Very high level of decrease in dam water availability. Long dry spells have caused problems in water availability as dams get depleted. Service interruptions and water rationing measures might be needed more often, impacting poorer communities more.2. High level of increase of drought-related health impacts. Particulate matter suspended in the air can irritate lungs, causing chronic respiratory illnesses.3. High level of threatened biodiversity because of drought. Prolonged drought may lead to drops in biodiversity - the variety and number of species, possibly leading to more serious consequences, such as ecosystem collapses.4. Medium level of drought-related decline in food productions. Increased dry spells and droughts may result in crop damage and reduction in yields affecting the food supply in Quezon City. Decreased food production may have economic implications potentially affecting the poor and marginalized communities.5. Medium level of threatened food security. Food security in Quezon City may be threatened due to dependence of food supply from external sources affected by drought.

Quezon City is developing aggressively, and the effects of urbanization with the replacement of vegetation by buildings changes the microclimate, raising summer temperatures in the city up to 7°C.Between 1951-2010, there has been a significant decrease in cold nights and an increase in hot days: both days and nights in particular are becoming warmer.Temperatures in Quezon City are expected to increase due to climate change. Climate projections from PAGASA suggest continuous warming in the future, with the largest increase in the summer months of March, April and May. Under a high emissions scenario, the mean temperature in the Philippines could increase by as much as 1.2 - 2.3°C until 2050.The following are the expected impacts of the hazard in the future for Quezon City:1. Very high level of heat stress causing illness and loss of life and livestock. Extreme heat conditions can cause heat-related diseases and can cause even death. Vulnerable groups include elderly and outside labour workers.2. High level of heat causing change in distribution and structure of biodiversity. Warming could pose an additional stress on vulnerable ecosystems and the species they host and could result in the crossing of climatic thresholds that some species cannot keep up with.3. Increase of water- and vector-borne diseases. Increased temperatures are linked with the increased transmission of vector and waterborne diseases like dengue and polio.4. High level of increasing water shortages. During heat waves, water use is increasing, impacting especially vulnerable poor groups.5. Medium level of increased energy consumption and emissions. In Quezon City, a lot of energy is used for cooling buildings. During heat waves, demand for air conditioning will go up, also leading to higher carbon emissions.

Future sea level rise may affect power plants, transmission towers and substations located along the coastal areas.The probable causes of erosion can be due to natural and anthropogenic causes such as prevailing waves; Sea level rise (SLR) will cause coastline setback; ship wakes attributed to nearby vessels’ passage; and oil spills, rubbish and wood dust discharged from vessels that are brought ashore by incoming tides. The erosion has caused extensive damage to public property and the surrounding mangroves. As a national park with Ramsar status, it is crucial for Tanjung Piai to uphold certain quality and quantity of its mangroves. It also may affect the status of the Southernmost Tip of Mainland Asia and the social-economic status of the local community and their livelihood that depend on the area as nursery for fishes etc. Mitigation measures have been put in place through the erection of a sea-wall off coast of Tg.

There are 7 city jurisdictional rivers including Nantunxi, Laojiexi, Fulinxi, Datunxi, Guanyinxi, Xinwuxi and Shezixi. When heavy rain occurs, it is easy to cause flooding. The northwest coastal area of Taoyuan City is with low relief and is full of streams. When the rainstorm hits, the flooded area is dominated by the various river basins. According to the second generation flooding potential map of Taoyuan City, at a 24-hour delay 500-year return period from continuous precipitation flooding simulation shows that the future flooding disaster in Taoyuan City will occurred around Dayuan, Zhongmu, Taoyuan, Luzhu, Guanyin, Xinwu and Yangmei basins.The increase of rainfall intensity increases the risk of flooding, slope sediment and compound disasters, resulting in loss of life and property of the people, causing road and bridge damage, road interruption, and increase the difficulty of evacuation and rescue. Rainfall is usually abundant and concentrated in mountain area in Taiwan, which is also easy to induce various landslide disasters along the roads, thus causing mountain roads to block.In extreme climate situations, long-delay-induced rainfall events increase, flooding disasters and sloping land complex disasters are easy to trigger, impact ecological, social and economic activities, and people's lives and property safety.

Increasing	Increasing	Medium High	Medium-term (2026-2050)	Water supplement and water usage have been an important issue in Taoyuan for many years. Although the water supply pressure in Taoyuan has been temporarily eased under the “Banxin District Water Supply Project Phase II”, the demand for water has increased year by year due to population and economic growth. Climate changes may cause the rainfall to plummet or tend to be extreme. There is still doubt in the future supply and demand of water in Taoyuan. Since 2002, Shimen Reservoir in Taoyuan has encountered five severe droughts and announced irrigation control, and implemented two times of third-stage zoning water supply measures.In the IPCC Fourth Report, the most likely scenario in the future, A1B, and the GCM with the worst water shortage, the water supply gap of Taoyuan is about 60,000 tons per day. If we consider the supply and demand conditions of water resources in Northern Taiwan at the same time, we can find that the normal water supply capacity of Taoyuan City will be deeply affected by climate change. If we consider the increase in water consumption caused by high temperature, climate change will aggravate the overall water balance, and it will threaten to crowd out agricultural water, causing rice fallow and insufficient water supply, resulting in damage to production and cutoff in output.The rainfall pattern is transformed into extreme, and the water resources scheduling is more difficult during the dry season. According to the “Impact assessment of climate change and rainfall on flood and drought” and the TaiWAP model of TaiCCAT, the variation of rainfall during the wet and dry seasons in the important catchment areas of northern Taiwan is due to increased rainfall during the wet season and reduced rainfall during the dry season. Overall, the trend of rainfall change has a significant impact on the water supply capacity of the Shimen Reservoir in Taoyuan.

Heavy snowfall and sudden slippery have impacts in wintertime, like injuries and falling tree branches. In agriculture, the crops will fall, the nutrients and pollutants start moving to waterbodies and have eutrophication impact or polluting impact.  So water protection and groundwater protection measures are needed and the costs of management will rise.

Also amount of precipitation will likely increase significantly, and more during winter than in summer. This creates difficulties for infrastructure and i.a. traffic management and critical infrastructures. Largest impacts may be secondary as climate warming changes agriculture in countries where Finland imports food. Also climate-related crisis may bring refugees to Finland. These secondary impacts were not assessed in the Lahti Adaptation Plan.  The overall warming has serious direct impacts in Lahti: The ground frost changes, which has impacts in infrastucture, maintenance and ground and water ecosystems. The time when the lakes are frozen, is shortening. Alien species and changes in species in i.e. forests. Forest fires. Also new human diseases. As winters get warmer, the slippery injuries and infections are more often.  Also the maintenance costs increase for example the bus fleet may have problems when temperature is near zero C, sometimes over it and sometimes below it. Also more salt will be put on streets and sidewalks and that means threat to groundwater and air quality. Also erosion of infrastructures grow.

The people should be more prepared and have reserves at home. The building and maintenance costs will rise as the structures like roofs and piers need to be built more firm - and for example breakwaters need to be built in Lahti harbours. Extreme winds also rise nutrient-rich water from bottom of the lakes and that creates algae blooms and have other effects on biodiversity like bird nesting.

That small village is partially in the current city center. Since then the coastline and the harbor have change dramatically with landfills. The city center (including the city hall) is a major tourist attraction for the city as the oldest part of the city and is located in a low lying, increasingly flood prone area which are under greater risk of being flooded due to higher sea level. The city center has a tremendous cultural value connected with both the city’s and the country's settlement history. Assessments agree that the rise in sea level is likely to increase the risk of coastal floods. Coastal flood will probably affect community & culture, transport and commercial services within the city.

Ela abrange a calha do rio São Francisco, 14 afluentes de gestão federal, os lagos dos seis reservatórios da bacia e o complexo Paulo Afonso, na Bahia.  Um dos impactos sentidos com a seca, que iniciou em 2010, foi a redução do volume da Barragem de Sobradinho, com volume útil de 28 bilhões de m³ e capacidade para armazenar 34 bilhões de m³ de água. Para preservar os estoques, a ANA vem autorizando a Companhia Hidrelétrica do São Francisco (Chesf) a reduzir a vazão mínima média das represas de Sobradinho e Xingó desde abril de 2013. Sem essa intervenção, Sobradinho teria esgotado seu volume útil em novembro de 2014, segundo a agência. A estiagem provocou redução da umidade do ar, chegando a porcentagens críticas, o que aumentou da poluição atmosférica pela maior concentração de poluentes e partículas suspensas no ar, culminando no aumento de problemas respiratórios na população. Ela também contribuiu para o aumento da salinização, que impacta diretamente na saúde pública. Se aumenta a salinidade as pessoas passam de fato a beber água mais salgada. Aumentam os casos de hipertensão, os municípios tendem a gastar mais com esses casos. Fora isso, tem a vida lacustre. A vida dos peixes, as quantidades e variedades vão sendo reduzidas drasticamente. Hoje é o mar que está entrando no rio. E quanto você escuta dizer que pescadores pegam peixes de alto mar, é verdade. A água do mar está invadindo o rio quando o natural seria o inverso.

Visto que o plano de drenagem do município (elaborado em 2013) previa a construção de dois piscinões que até o momento não foram construídos, acredita-se que mais episódios de alagamento deverão ocorrer, afetando principalmente a população que ocupa áreas alagáveis (invasão) e o trânsito.  Como forma de evitar novos transtornos, hoje, quando da autorização de projetos de regularização fundiária, é requisitado que sejam consideradas as cotas de inundações para chuvas ocorridas nas microbacias.

Por conta dessa crise, no município de Sumaré foram criadas leis para reduzir o consumo de água, como aquela que obriga serviços de lava-rápido a tratarem e reutilizarem a água de lavagem. Há, entretanto, muita pressão na área de proteção de manancial, uma vez que há desejo de expansão da área urbana. Além disso, nos últimos anos foram construídos diversos condomínios residenciais. Considerando que o município não é autônomo na produção de água para seus moradores, a pressão e demanda pela água vão aumentar. Dessa forma, na eventualidade de uma nova crise hídrica, estaremos muito suscetíveis aos problemas advindos.

A ocorrência frequente de episódios de cheia e a grande vulnerabilidade e exposição da população a este risco são fatores a ter em consideração. O problema das cheias em Águeda não é uma questão recente. No entanto, constata-se que a frequência e intensidade dos episódios de cheia tem vindo a agravar-se nos últimos anos. As zonas de maior altitude são, pela sua morfologia, as que mais contribuem para a intensificação dos fenómenos de precipitação, aumentando o caudal dos cursos de água. Assim, a cidade de Águeda encontra-se frequentemente sujeita a inundações, agravadas pela indevida ocupação dos leitos de cheia, pelas pontes e estrangulamentos existentes no leito menor e pela obstrução transversal provocada por aterros do leito maior. Também a morfologia das bacias hidrográficas e os usos do solo contribuem para potenciar este fenómeno. As consequências destes episódios têm sido alvo de atenção por parte dos meios de comunicação social locais, os quais refletem o desânimo e a descrença política da população, os prejuízos frequentemente avultados, nomeadamente, com a inundação de estabelecimentos e habitações, a destruição de explorações agropecuárias, constrangimentos nas infraestruturas.Em média a precipitação deverá diminuir, no entanto a precipitação intensa deverá aumentar, ocorrendo concentrada em pouco espaço de tempo e provocando maiores impactos, levando a:- Alterações nos estilos de vida- Danos em equipamentos, infraestruturas e vias de comunicação- Danos para as cadeias de produção e alterações nos usos de equipamentos- Danos para a saúde humana- Danos para a vegetação- Danos em setores como o turismo e a agricultura- Problemas para a saúde, sendo que os grupos normalmente mais sensíveis (população mais idosa, crianças, populações mais isoladas, indivíduos com mobilidade condicionada ou fisicamente dependentes) continuarão a ser aquelas que apresentam maior vulnerabilidade.

Até aqui, a cidade e território têm respondido em conformidade, não só devido à resposta da Proteção Civil e de todas as entidades envolvidas mas também a ações desenvolvidas que permitiram, por exemplo, um menor tempo de reação perante a ocorrência de focos de incêndio e um sistema de alerta eficiente.De referir ainda o papel de destaque que as Juntas de Freguesias têm no contexto da adaptação e mitigação das alterações climáticas, em particular pela sua proximidade à população, entre outros atores-chave.Em relação ao longo prazo e à aprendizagem com eventos passados, é tido em conta e a título de exemplo as questões associadas à eficácia de resposta, à capacidade de adaptação e à gestão do risco. No que diz respeito à eficácia, foram detetadas algumas lacunas associadas a alguma inexistência de informação específica. Relativamente à capacidade de adaptação e à avaliação das vulnerabilidades atuais constata-se a inexistência de equipas específicas de resposta. A gestão do risco, somente será eficaz se houver um investimento na adoção de medidas preventivas e reativas específicas devendo a sua operacionalização ser melhor planeada. A eficácia somente poderá ser medida ou classificada se for registada e avaliada pelo que se identifica necessário estabelecer um procedimento de gestão de risco climático.Com o aumento da temperatura também as secas e a ocorrência de fogos florestais tenderão a aumentar, com a consequente ocorrência de:- Intensificação dos danos para a saúde- Alteração no estilo de vida- Alterações na biodiversidade e no património ambiental e natural- Danos para a vegetação- Danos para as cadeias de produção e alterações nos usos de equipamentos- Problemas para a saúde, perda de bens e alteração do uso de equipamentos e serviços sendo que osgrupos normalmente mais sensíveis (população mais idosa, crianças, populações mais isoladas,indivíduos com mobilidade condicionada ou fisicamente dependentes) continuarão a ser aquelasque apresentam maior vulnerabilidade.

Nesse sentido, o concelho pretende melhorar a sua resposta a esta e outras vulnerabilidades, sendo uma das suas apostas a melhoria do ambiente urbano, garantindo atratividade e sustentabilidade. Exemplos disso são a criação de mais áreas verdes, plantação de árvores, etc. A exposição aos fatores climáticos acentua o impacto em quase todos os setores designadamente, na biodiversidade, energia, turismo, ordenamento do território, saúde, segurança de pessoas e bens, mas em particular na gestão dos impactos dos eventos mais severos com incidência na segurança de pessoas e bens e no turismo sendo expectáveis para o concelho as seguintes alterações climáticas com influência na ocorrência e intensidade de secas:- Diminuição da precipitação média anual, com potencial aumento da precipitação no inverno.i. Média anual: Diminuição da precipitação média anual.ii. Precipitação sazonal: diminuição nos meses de inverno apresentando diminuições mais significativas na primavera e outono.iii. Secas mais frequentes e intensas: diminuição significativa do número de dias com precipitação, aumentando a frequência e intensidade das secas.- Aumento da temperatura média anual, em especial das máximas.i. Média anual e sazonal: subida da temperatura média anual e aumento significativo das temperaturas máximas no verão.ii. Dias muito quentes: aumento do número de dias com temperaturas muito altas (> 35ºC), e de noites tropicais, com temperaturas mínimas >20ºC.iii. Ondas de calor: ondas de calor mais frequentes e intensas.Os impactes da intensificação das secas na biodiversidade e a degradação de habitats, especialmente nas áreas protegidas concelhias e espécies endémicas, assim como sobre as variações nas recargas e nos níveis piezométricos dos sistemas de aquíferos existentes no território em análise, deve ser aprofundado.Socialmente os efeitos da seca intensa pode levar a um abandono da agricultura tradicional, com perda de postos de trabalho e a produção de alimentos a nível local. Igualmente a falta de disponibilidade de água por efeito da seca leva a uma recarga deficiente dos lençóis freáticos e a uma maior pressão de extração de águas subterrâneas; as águas superficiais podem ver degradada a sua qualidade.

O Rio Cávado é um rio com enorme relevo nacional passando pelos concelhos de Montalegre, Terras de Bouro, Vieira do Minho, Amares, Póvoa de Lanhoso, Vila Verde, Barcelos, Esposende e desagua no Oceano Atlântico após um percurso de 135 km. A bacia hidrográfica do rio Cávado é limitada, a norte, pela bacia hidrográfica do rio Neiva e do rio Lima e, a este e sul, pelas bacias do rio Douro e do rio Ave; tem uma área de 1600 km². O escoamento anual na foz do rio é, em média, de 2123 hm3, o que corresponde a 1615 m3/s. Estima-se que a bacia hidrográfica do rio Cávado apresente uma capacidade total de armazenamento de recursos hídricos na ordem dos 1180 hm3, em regime regularizado, valor que corresponde a quase 30% do total existente em Portugal. O rio Este nasce na serra do Carvalho, na União de freguesias de Este e atravessa todo o concelho desaguando no rio Ave, já no concelho vizinho de Vila Nova de Famalicão. Este rio drena uma bacia bastante significativa onde se situa grande parte da malha urbana da cidade.  A rápida urbanização registada nos anos 90 da cidade permitiu descuidos na concepção urbana que não considerou os fluxos dinâmicos do circulo urbano da água. Devido a estas desconsiderações registou-se desde inicio do século zonas de enchentes problemáticas no centro da cidad. Assim em situações de elevada pluviosidade, toda a água da chuva é encaminhada para este rio, o que leva a um aumento significativo do caudal que em alguns pontos extravasa a secção do rio e provoca inundações. Nós últimos anos têm sido desenvolvidos vários projetos de renaturalizaçao das margens e espaços contíguos ao rio, e têm sido efetuadas várias ações de limpeza do leito e das margens, de modo a permitir um melhor escoamento. No que diz respeito a inundações e os danos causados pelo transbordo dos rios destaca-se os impactos sentidos na cidade e que o perigo afetará no futuro: - Danos em edifícios e seu conteúdo;- Condicionamentos de tráfego;- Danos para a saúde;- Danos para a vegetação e alterações na biodiversidade- Falhas no fornecimento de energia.

No caso rural, com muitas produções agrícolas de pequena dimensão, o uso do fogo para queima de sobrantes agrícolas e florestais é a principal origem dos incêndios rurais mas também uma das maiores fontes para a diminuição da qualidade do ar no Município. Esta prática, muitas vezes realizada por motivos até culturais, não só constitui um comportamento de risco, mas também uma fonte de emissões atmosféricas, destruindo nutrientes e matéria orgânica essenciais aos solos. No caso das emissões de poluentes atmosféricos, estima-se que por cada 100 quilos de sobrantes agrícolas e florestais são emitidos 158 quilos de dióxido de carbono (C02), 10 quilos de monóxido de carbono, cinco quilos de compostos orgânicos voláteis não metânicos, 0,6 quilos de metano, 0,5 quilos de partículas finas, bem como benzeno, amónia, óxidos de azoto e carbono negro. Entre 2010 e 2019 a média anual de incêndios originados em queimas e queimadas é de 34%, acrescentando que queimar esses sobrantes, como por exemplo podas de oliveiras, ""não tem qualquer justificação ambiental"".O impacto deste tipo de situação tem provocado problemas de saúde pública nomeadamente o aumento do risco de problemas respiratórios na população."

É projetado, ainda, um aumento da frequência de ondas de calor. Nos últimos ocorreram uma série de ondas de calor no Muncípio de Braga e as áreas mais vulneráveis concentram-se nas freguesias mais próximos do sector urbano central. O aumento das temperaturas terá consequências para a saúde, mas não apenas em termos de ondas de calor. O aumento da temperatura à noite também pode ter impacto, pois o período de descanso noturno é quando as pessoas se recuperam do calor durante o dia. O calor excessivo e sustentado leva a um aumento nas taxas de mortalidade e morbidade, especialmente entre os grupos mais vulneráveis, como idosos, bebés, pessoas com deficiência física ou intelectual que têm dificuldade de locomoção ou autoajuda, pessoas com doenças crônicas, aqueles que tomam medicamentos que afetam o sistema nervoso central e quem vive em situação de precariedade social. Em termos de ondas de calor futuras estima-se que cerca de 23 894 residentes serão muito vulneráveis ao desconforto térmico nas habitações no Verão. Estas são pessoas com mais de 65 anos, residentes em freguesias de Braga com vulnerabilidade em cenários de onda de calor. No que diz respeito a ondas de calor destaca-se os impactos sentidos na cidade e que o perigo afetará no futuro: - risco para idosos e gestão de lares- aumento do risco de incêndio e ocorrência - Saúde Pública

O registo de danos por ventos fortes em Braga aconteceu em Braga, produzindo, em poucas horas, onde se registaram ventos máximos da ordem de 100 a 130 km/h.No que diz respeito a vento forte destaca-se os impactos sentidos na cidade e que o perigo afetará no futuro: - Danos em Edifícos;- Danos na vegetação;- Alteração da identidade da cidade.O vento em solos desprotegidos (eventualmente cobertos de cinzas) e secos, aumentará a taxa de partículas no ar, a acrescentar aos gases da própria combustão (incêndios), o que aumentará a poluição atmosférica e, portanto os problemas de saúde do foro respiratório. Os danos em infraestruturas, edifícios, equipamentos e viaturas podem ocorrer devido aos ventos fortes e queda de árvores e/ou ramos podem destruir telhados o que, associado à chuva pode aumentar enormemente os prejuízos, e portanto os custos a eles associados, aquando da reconstrução, e ainda, agravamento de seguros.

As áreas rurais que outrora predominavam, hoje, confinam-se aos limites do concelho. É ainda de salientar que as colinas de maior cota e as montanhas encontram-se cobertas por manchas florestais, apesar da pressão urbana e dos fogos florestais que sucederam nos últimos anos. A topografia do território de Braga está demarcada por zonas irregulares  declives acentuadas. Associada à topografia acentuada do concelho, se houver incêndios florestais e depois chuvadas intensas, há grandes riscos de derrocadas/deslizamento de solos, mas também o mesmo pode ocorrer se grandes extensões de solo em zonas declivosas se encontrarem sem qualquer cobertura que os estabilize, ou com cobertura de raízes curtas ou frágeis. Neste sentido, nos últimos anos foi necessário ter particular cuidado com esses terrenos, bem como tentar reduzir o risco de arrastamento de detritos para as linhas de água, que pode agravar as inundações por criação de barreiras ao fluxo da água, e mesmo levar à destruição de infraestruturas e pôr em risco pessoas e animais. Prevê-se que a agricultura será um dos setores mais afetados. Poderá ocorrer uma cada vez maior perda de solo fértil, causando a redução da produtividade agrícola e florestal, e o consequente abandono da agricultura/silvicultura, ficando as terras sem uso e aumentando o risco de erosão. Este impacto tem particular interesse público e patrimonial pelo risco que á zona do Bom Jesus, considerada património mundial em 2019.

Um dos mais significativos advêm dos padrões meteorológicos mais extremos principalmente por tempestade de chuva.  No últimos anos regitou-se bastante danos em zonas urbanas com as inundações que extremas desencadeadas por chuvas muito fortes, de longa duração, muito frequentes ou pela combinação desses três factores. Embora seja difícil estabelecer um vínculo direto entre um único evento extremo e a mudança climática, é claro para o Município que a frequência será mais frequente e que episódios hidrometeorológicos extremos irão aumentar devido às mudanças climáticasAs investigações para a região do Atlântico Continental principalmente apontam a possibilidade de ocorrer eventos hidrometeorológicos extremos com mais frequência, como fortes tempestades no inverno ou secas prolongadas no Verão. Em 2019, foi registado num só dia uma precipitação de 51,1 milímetros por metro quadrado, considerado um fenómeno excepcional de precipitação nunca antes registado. Os impactos deste aumento no futuro pelo aumento da precipitação acima destes valores estão identificados em: - Condicionamentos de tráfego/encerramento de vias- Danos em edifícios e/ou conteúdo- Danos para bens e pessoas oriundas de inundação

Para além dos prejuízos económicos e ambientais, constituem uma fonte de perigo para as populações e bens. Os incêndios são considerados catástrofes naturais, mais pelo facto de se desenvolverem na natureza e por a sua possibilidade de ocorrência e caraterísticas de propagação dependerem fortemente de fatores naturais, do que por serem causados por fenómenos naturais.Como a propagação de um incêndio depende das condições meteorológicas (direção e intensidade do vento, humidade relativa do ar, temperatura), do grau de secura e do tipo do coberto vegetal, orografia do terreno, acessibilidades ao local do incêndio, tempo de intervenção (tempo entre o alerta e a primeira intervenção no ataque ao fogo, vulgarmente designada como ataque inicial), a sua ocorrência está bastante relacioanda com as alterações climáticas. Uma área devastada por um incêndio, quando sujeita a chuvas intensas, pode tornar-se mais susceptível e originar mais facilmente, outro tipo de riscos tais como deslizamentos e cheias. Com a destruição da camada superficial vegetativa os solos ficam mais vulneráveis a fenómenos de erosão e transporte provocados pelas águas pluviais, reduzindo também a sua permeabilidade.Com o crescimento das áreas residenciais na direcção da floresta, os seus habitantes ficam sujeitos a um risco acrescido a este tipo de fenómenos. A ameaça dos incêndios florestais para pessoas que habitem em áreas florestais ou nas suas imediações, ou que utilizem estes espaços para fins recreativos é real. Um pré planeamento e o conhecimento de medidas preventivas têm diminuido os danos.Para além da destruição da floresta os incêndios podem ser responsáveis por:- Morte e ferimentos nas populações e animais (queimaduras, inalação de partículas e gases);- Destruição de bens (casas, armazéns, postes de electricidade e comunicações, etc.);- Corte de vias de comunicação;- Alterações, por vezes de forma irreversível, do equilíbrio do meio natural;- Proliferação e disseminação de pragas e doenças, quando o material ardido não é tratado convenientemente

This trend will be experienced both asincreasing average or “new normal” temperaturesand as more extreme, less predictable heat events.It is very likely that Cambridge will experience heatwaves of greater frequency and duration and thatthis shift will have implications for both human healthand the built environment. Northern cities are lessadapted to extreme heat because of little historicalneed to do so.  The duration and intensity of heat waves havesignificant implications for public health – especiallyfor vulnerable populations that do not have accessto sufficient cooling options. Each passing day ofextreme heat decreases a person’s ability to copewith the heat stress. This is especially threatening for the very young, the elderly, and those with existinghealth challenges like cardiovascular, circulatory, andrespiratory conditions. Increased mortality and morbidity, and possible effects on electricity distribution are expected.

Due to the sudden downpour, many places were flooded, lots of agricultural products were damaged, and the river was inundated in the Hengchun Peninsula. The future impacts and the risk of the surface flood have been calculated and simulated. Based on the data from 1973~2003, and the implementation of RCP 8.5 in AR 5, the result showed that the risk of flooding in Ligang Township, Gaoshu Township, Jiuru Township, and Yanpu Township would be upgraded from the level 1 to the highest level during 2075 to 2099. In the future, as the deterioration of climate change increases, the intensity of precipitation will increase, resulting in severe damage and threatens the residents' lives and property safety in Pingtung.

Firstly, due to the geographic condition, when cold front travels from the north to the south, frontal rain is likely to occur in Pumping. Secondly, hot weather heats the surface causes the humid convection and eventually results in a thunderstorm. Thirdly, result from the height difference between flat and hill, airflow be forced to raise and cause precipitation, finally, as a high-frequency-typhoons-form area, precipitation from typhoons is logically reasonable. Due to the rising temperature result from climate change, the conversation and front would be more intense, and it might lead to a higher volume of precipitation in Pumping.

The increased rainfall creates a plethora of issues, especially in regards to human health. Increased precipitation leads to increased flooding which creates grounds for more injuries and waterborne disease outbreaks to occur (Filippelli et al., 2018). Continued moisture in buildings also increases the likelihood of mold growth, and therefore, intensified allergen and asthma issues (Filippelli et al., 2018). Furthermore, the combination of hot temperatures and increased rain create breeding grounds for toxic algae to prevail, further extrapolating the health issues that can occur as a result of increased rain and flooding (Filippelli et al., 2018). However, Carmel has prioritized investing in infrastructure that prevents the consequences of flooding. The city's development standards and patterns avoid areas where flooding will impact a great deal of our commercial or residential activities. Therefore, flooding in this area does pose a risk to residents, but due to Carmel's innovative planning, the effects are not as heavily felt."

These heavy rain events increase flooding risks and  can pollute water through sewer system overflow (Filippelli et al., 2018). However, Carmel has adapted to this risk by making additional investments in upgrading the city's storm sewer system and all combined sewers in Carmel have been removed."

Subsidence is variable throughout the lowlands of Surrey; however, for the purposes of detailed impact work an average value of 0.225 mm / year was assumed recognizing the need for more advanced assessments on this item.Combining the effects of rising seas and subsidence, Surrey is projected to see a net SLR increase of 1.195 m (2010 base) by 2100. Further studies are being undertaken to better understand the combined effect of SLR with heavy precipitation events, storm surge, wave effects and wind events in Surrey.  Increased probability that existing sea dykes will be overtopped due to a combination of SLR, subsidence, and storm surge and wind setup resulting from significant weather events. Increased  impacts on the viability of agricultural crops and other vegetation in floodplain areas, due to saltwater intrusion associated with SLR.

Results from specialized high resolution models indicate that the daytime summer high temperatures can be expected to be warmer than present-day San Diego by the 2050s in a high warming scenario, and by the 2080s in a lower-warming scenario. The citizens of Surrey have to prepare for extreme heat events and modify their behavior when weather poses a health risk.

Over the past twenty years there have been no recorded large-scale fires within Surrey’s park natural areas. However, the risk of wildfires is likely to increase with warmer, drier temperatures and increasing tree mortalities.  Many natural areas are adjacent to important structures that are at risk should a natural area fire occur. In 2013, the City completed a Community Wildfire Protection Plan that identifies areas at high risk of wildfires, acknowledges the importance of climate change in managing wildfire risk in the future, and recommends the plan be reviewed every five years.

De hecho, algunos científicos coinciden en que los efectos de la variabilidad climática interanual, se están mezclando y potenciando con los efectos del cambio climático.De acuerdo al IMN en términos generales, se espera una reducción de la precipitación en el norte del país (Pacífico Norte, Zona Norte y Región Central). Hacia el sur del país se espera un aumento de precipitación en especial sobre la parte peninsular. Hacia el Caribe, no se observan cambios importantes en la zona montañosa, pero sí se presenta un aumento. En términos generales, se espera una reducción de la precipitación en el norte del país (Pacífico Norte, Zona Norte y Región Central). Hacia el sur del país se espera un aumento de precipitación en especial sobre la parte peninsular. Hacia el Caribe, no se observan cambios importantes en la zona montañosa, pero sí se presenta un aumento significativo de las lluvias en la costa, principalmente hacia el sur de la vertiente. Por tanto, el clima de Costa Rica se verá sometido a extremos del clima secos y lluviosos. De acuerdo con el estudio del IMN, y si las condiciones de variabilidad siguen dominando la expresión anual del clima, existen múltiples fenómenos que pueden aumentar o disminuir su frecuencia e intensidad para explicar estas variaciones encontradas. Los resultados obtenidos con la precipitación son coherentes con los datos estimados de temperaturas. Las zonas más secas se relacionan con las zonas más cálidas durante el día, mientras que un aumento en las precipitaciones en el Caribe costero y la zona Sur, puede provocar que la temperatura durante la noche aumente con más intensidad que en otras partes del país, por efecto de retención de radiación de onda larga (la que emite la Tierra hacia el espacio durante la noche) por el aumento del vapor de agua (gas de efecto invernadero).

Estas regiones que son afectadas por los caudales extraordinarios y se identifican como zonas con potencial de inundaciones. Otro aspecto negativo y potenciador de inundaciones es el lanzamiento de residuos sólidos a los cauces, así como al sistema de alcantarillado, ya que los obstruyen y no permite que el agua tenga la escorrentía necesaria. En los últimos 10 años (aproximadamente) ha disminuido el período de recurrencia de inundaciones a un año y algunos períodos menores. Esto a causa de las fuertes lluvias y de la invasión de las planicies de inundación por parte de un considerable grupo de población.A través de un estudio, se mapean los principales centros poblados del cantón de La Unión están bajo esta amenaza, tal es el caso de Concepción, Tres Ríos, San Juan, San Diego, Dulce Nombre, San Rafael, con la excepción de San Ramón, pues esta es la región donde la diferencia de altitud hace que no se presente este peligro.

Estudios recientes han valorado posibles efectos del cambio climático sobre la producción de maíz, fríjol y café. Los resultados sugieren que es posible que para los tres cultivos ya se haya rebasado la temperatura que permite lograr los mayores rendimientos, por lo que es probable que ya se estén teniendo  pérdidas de producción; además, incrementos futuros en la temperatura podrían generar mayores pérdidas. El análisis realizado sobre la producción agropecuaria (agrícola y pecuaria) y los cultivos en su conjunto de forma global sugiere que es probable que se haya rebasado la temperatura que permite  en los tres casos alcanzar los mayores márgenes de producción. De igual forma los niveles de precipitación observados en los últimos años son inferiores a los que permiten lograr la mayor producción. Así, el cambio climático ya puede estar teniendo efectos adversos sobre toda la producción agropecuaria.

Since then, additional defences have been built to protect other areas of the city. These defences have been designed for a 1% Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP) or 1 in 100 year event; however, predictions indicate that the country will experience warmer, wetter winters and hotter, drier summers resulting in more extreme rainfall events. As a result, flooding of greater magnitude and frequency from all sources is expected and the current standard of protection has now fallen to 2% AEP or 1 in 50.Transport – Road closures affecting evacuation and response from emergency servicesProperty – During the 2000 floods, 3000 residents had to be evacuated from their home.Business – Loss of telephone services to 50,000 customers.

The impacts were significant, with increased stress on the agricultural sector in the County, on the low-income communities, and also on the infrastructure of the city. The heat waves also endangered the elderly and the very young, who were threatened by the intense heat. In the future, these groups will be hit by the impact of intense heat during the summer months, with inability to get adequate resources being the main issue for marginalized groups dealing with the intense heat. The strain on the Agricultural sector will be consistent as well, as the sector will deal with drought-like conditions and the water supply being reduced. These conditions will also accelerate the erosion damage on infrastructure throughout the city, such as roads and bridges.

City will also have to expend funds to prepare for and cleanup after the event.  In 2019 we experienced the second highest flood on record, and it persisted for a long time.  This flood fighting and clean up negatively affected our city budget and put many municipal functions on hold due to the cost of flood containment and, later, cleanup.  There was also significant economic damage as portions of downtown were flooded or shut down for many weeks.  While much of the issue is as much about levies along the Mississippi River as climate change, we recognize that climate change increases the problem.

Increasing	Increasing	Medium	Short-term (by 2025)	The drainage of rainwater from urban areas occurs either through the sewer system, at streams or through a combination of these possibilities. Under normal conditions, this works without problems. Elsinore municipality, like other municipalities, has problems handling rainwater during extreme rainfall. This can result in areas being flooded and that some homeowners in extreme cases experience water entering the house. The reason is usually either that the sewers cannot keep up, or that large amounts of rainwater cannot be accommodated in the water streams.At extreme rainfall, which gives extensive floods, Elsinore Municipality's emergency plan applies. The emergency plan describes how to handle the flood, including how personnel are distributed where pumps are requested, which roads must be blocked etc.The scope of the climate hazards is, as explained above, in smaller districts within the municipality.

Particularmente, en las horas punta de calor, los sistemas de transporte no poseen suficiente climatización para reducir el impacto en los usuarios. Ademas, se suma a una demanda eléctrica para los edificios por mantener una temperatura adecuada para el confort térmico.  Por otro lado, aumenta la demanda hídrica, generando una mayor presión externa hacia dicho recurso. Las olas de calor pueden afectar de mayor manera a grupos con enfermedades crónicas y a grupos marginados que no tienen acceso a sistemas de climatización para paliar las altas temperaturas.

La primera ocurre por incapacidad técnica de la empresa encargada del suministro de agua potable de tratar las aguas generadas por las tormentas, las cuales debido al efecto de la intensidad de la lluvia, ingresan a la planta de tratamiento con un mayor número de sedimentos. Esto provoca como medida de contingencia el cierre de las compuertas, generando un corte del suministro de agua a nivel de ciudad. A pesar de ser un fenómeno que ocurre fuera de los limites jurisdiccionales de Providencia este corresponde a un impacto significativo en la vida cotidiana de los ciudadanos de la comuna. La segunda ocurre principalmente por situaciones generadas en las instalaciones públicas del sistema de suministro eléctrico, pudiendo afectar a baja escala o mas bien expresarse de manera comunal o de ciudad.Las tormentas afectan directamente a los sistemas de transporte, ya que al haber inconvenientes en los suministros de energía, las instalaciones de alumbrado público y señaléticas no funcionan, esto sumado a los problemas ocasionados por el colapso en los sistemas de alcantarillado que obligan a los conductores a conducir a menor velocidad . Esto se ve reflejado en congestión en la red vial y congestión en los servicios de transporte público. Esto afecta indirectamente el desplazamiento de las personas a sus trabajos, sobre todo a los trabajadores independientes.

Esto, radica principalmente en que dicho compuesto molecular propicia un mayor aumento de la temperatura en la atmósfera y por consiguiente un escenario de menor ventilación de los gases de efecto invernadero (GEI). Al existir menos ventilación, la calidad del aire disminuye drásticamente y trae consigo enfermedades de índole respiratoria, al mismo tiempo que genera la precipitación de gases tóxicos cuando se presentan las primeras lluvias de invierno, contaminando el suelo y cursos de agua que posteriormente son utilizados para diversas actividades de subsistencia humana, y en paralelo afectando de manera directa a las funciones y servicios ecosistémicos provistos por el medio natural presente en la comuna. Del mismo modo, el mismo ejercicio humano de transporte, agrava de manera sustancial la calidad del aire, existiendo un componente cultural asociado al uso particular de vehículos de transporte. En entendimiento del contexto presentado, se generan restricciones vehiculares de índole privada para disminuir las emisiones de dicho componente atmosférico.

With increasing temperatures, drought conditions and variety in weather events combined with beetles and pests fire danger is increasing. A large forest fire could be devastating to the community, both residents and commercial.  Vail has been fortunate to date, however there have been several forest fires in nearby communities in the past few years. Smoke from these fires has been prevelant in the Vail community, impairing air quality.  While Vail removes deadfall in forests, provides information on fire resistant landscaping,  implemented defensible space requirements, as well as other building requirements to minimize risk related to fires, Vail is not immune to wildfires and hopes risk management strategies will protect people, property and wildlands in the event that a wildfire does occur.

Vulnerable populations who may not have access to cool spaces for heat relief could be at an increased exposure to this hazard. Extreme heat events have the potential to increase society's energy demand due to the necessity for cooling needs. A higher demand could lead to energy shortages or a blackout event depending on the energy infrastructure system itself and the severity and duration of the high temperature event. To date, this hazard has not had a significant impact on the City of Mississauga, however, heat waves and extreme hot temperatures are expected to intensify, the severity of which is projected to impact the City in the future.

Not specific to City of Bend, but is an issue of regional importance. Local irrigation districts have run completely out of water before the end of irrigation system several years due to insufficient water stored in the reservoir. As a result, farmers are forced to make fields go fallow in the middle of the season. Additionally, Bend is depending on mountain winter recreation (i.e. skiing) to support its economy. If drought conditions were to worsen over time, reduced snowpack in the mountains would affect Bend's economy.

According to downscaled climate change projections developed by DC, in the past, the average heatwave in the area lasted just under 5 days. In the future, the average length is expected to be around 6 days by the 2020s, 8 to 9.5 days by mid-century, and 9.5 days to 12 by the 2080s. Vulnerable populations including the elderly, homeless residents, low income residents and those with medical conditions are most at risk for heat stroke and other heat related health conditions, due to exposure and limited mobility. Heat waves will also impact energy infrastructure, as peak demand for cooling could strain the distribution system, and transportation as existing roads and rail lines were not designed for temperature extremes expected by the 2080s.

Takoma Park currently has an average of 10 days per year with greater than 1 inch of rain in a given 24-hour period.  That number is projected to increase to 12 days by the 2050s and 13 days by the 2080s. The number of days per year with more than 2 inches of rainfall per 24-hour period is expected to increase, to an average of 3.5 days per year by the 2050s and between 3.5-4.5 days per year by the 2080s. Changes in rainfall volumes have a significant impact on drainage infrastructure and flooding ( see also coastal, flash/surface flood). As precipitation patterns become more intense and frequent, the effectiveness of new construction projects designed to alleviate flooding and/or upgrades to existing stormwater and wastewater infrastructure to mitigate flooding will need to be evaluated.

The drought was worsened by the effects of climate change reducing the Sierra snowpack, a vital stockpile of freshwater. In 2015, the Governor issued Executive Order B-29-15, proclaiming a continued state of emergency due to the ongoing drought and mandated that all Californians collectively reduce their potable water use by 25%. Later rules by the State Water Resources Control Board required the city to reduce its 2013 baseline use of potable water by 16%.  Through the City’s Water Conservation Plan, which outlined measures to achieve targeted water reductions at City facilities, the City was able to reduce its water use by 35%.In 2017, the Governor lifted the drought emergency for most of the state and asked Californians to continue using water responsibly and to make conservation a way of life.  A report issued in February 2018 by the U.S. Drought Monitor, a project of government agencies and other partners, showed that 44% of the state, including Los Angeles County where Culver City resides, is now considered to be in a moderate drought.As an urban area, Culver City experiences impacts typical to cities, including mandatory potable water conservation, urban heat islands, extreme heat days, surface water pollution, and impacted air quality.  Although California was declared drought-free in 2019, scientists predict that the current pattern of extreme drought followed by extreme precipitation will worsen in the years ahead.

Rising GHG levels contribute to an increase in the average temperature of the earth, affecting the weather, sea levels, and land-use patterns. The largest sources of GHG emissions from human activities are the burning of fossil fuels for electricity and transportation. In the short-term, increased levels of GHGs, contribute to adverse health effects like asthma and worsening allergies. The long-term impacts are likely to include more heatwaves and fewer water resources in semi-arid regions, like the Los Angeles basin. Negative impacts to air quality are a major concern for Culver City, as we are located at a hub of some of the region's major traffic routes: the 10 and 405 Freeways. Culver City currently has several major development projects under construction, which are anticipated to bring another 5,000 people into the city in the next few years. That means adding many more cars and congestion to our roadways, using more energy to operate those new buildings, and more people moving around the city. In 2019, Culver City selected 100% carbon-free, renewable electricity for its entire community. This was an increase from the prior 34% and this decision, though not without increased cost, has substantially reduced that amount of GHG emitted into the atmosphere from the production of electricity.  Culver City joined nine other cities in Los Angeles and Ventura Counties, who also selected 100% Green Power. The City's next focus is electrifying the transportation sector by constructing the infrastructure necessary to charge electric vehicles using 100% carbon-free, renewable electricity.

Significant flooding has occurred in the wider Los Angeles area, largely in the areas immediately around the Los Angeles River. The main waterway in Culver City is Ballona Creek, which runs approximately nine miles from the Mid-Wilshire neighborhood of Los Angeles through the City and out to the Pacific Ocean at Marina Del Rey. Ballona Creek was channelized, straightened, and deepened in the 1930s to control flooding. Centinela Creek, one of Ballona Creek's tributaries, runs along part of the community's southern border and was channelized in the 1960s.FEMA flood maps indicate that a few locations in the northern part of the City are at an elevated risk for flooding. A small area, bordered roughly by Ballona Creek, Fairfax Avenue, and Adams Boulevard lies with a 100-year flood zone for a one- to three-foot flood. Two additional areas nearby, one between Eastham Drive and Ballona Creek and the second in the area immediately adjacent to Ballona Creek between National Boulevard and Sentney Avenue, are also within a 100-year flood zone. However, FEMA does not specify the potential amount of inundation this area may experience. Another part of the City, between Adams Boulevard and Dauphin Street, is at risk from a flood capable of inundating less than one-foot with a chance of occurring between one in 100 and one in 500 in any given year.Although climate change is expected to lead to less precipitation and more droughts, some evidence suggests it may result in an increase in the number of more-intense storms due to a strengthening of the atmospheric river phenomenon. However, more research is needed. More intense storms are likely to drop a larger amount of water in a shorter period of time, increasing the risk of the volume of water overwhelming the ability of the soil or infrastructure to drain it away, thus creating flooding. The overall drier conditions are expected to dry out the soil, which makes it more difficult for water to soak into the ground, further increasing the risk of flooding.
Cities 2020	59644	City of Culver City, CA	United States of America	North America	Climate Hazards and Vulnerability	Climate Hazards	5		Wild fire > Land fire	Yes	High	High		Emergency services; Industrial; Residential		Increasing	Increasing	High		Wildland fires have historically occurred near the City and the surrounding Los Angeles region. In recent years, significant regional incidents have affected Los Angeles County and entire portions of the state. Severe wildfires occurred across the state during the 2008 fire season, causing extensive damage in the county and across California. Though none of the fire footprints were located within City boundaries, Culver City residents experienced the secondary effects of wildfire, including degraded air quality.Cal Fire prepares fire hazard severity maps, including maps showing areas of significant fire hazards based on fuels, terrain, weather, and other relevant factors. These zones, referred to as Fire Hazard Severity Zones (FHSZ), define how various mitigation strategies are applied and influence how people construct buildings and protect property to reduce the risk associated with wildland fires. According to the FHSZ map, the eastern portion of the City is located in a Very High Fire Severity Zone (VHFHSZ). The eastern part of the City in the VHFHSZ consists of specific properties in the Bianco/Culver Crest neighborhood that are considered to be in a wildland-urban interface. A wildland-urban interface is defined as anywhere the growth and spread of a fire may begin in a brush or wildland region, and then quickly enter an urban environment. Wildland areas located in Los Angeles County are directly adjacent to the City communities of Blair Hills and Culver Crest.The Inglewood Oil Field is located in the City and the unincorporated area of Los Angeles County known as Baldwin Hills. The oil field is approximately 1,000 acres, making it one of the largest contiguous urban oil fields in the United States. Ten percent of the oil field's acreage is in the City. In the past, the area has experienced brush fires, primarily as a result of electrical transformer failures. Because the Inglewood Oil Field and surrounding area are considered wildland-urban interface, the Culver City Fire Department is aware of the risk to the City and is prepared with the equipment necessary to address wildland-urban interface fires in this area.Although wildfires occur naturally and play a long-term role in the health of ecosystems, climate change threatens to increase the frequency, extent, and severity of fires through increased temperatures and drought.
Cities 2020	59644	City of Culver City, CA	United States of America	North America	Climate Hazards and Vulnerability	Climate Hazards	6		Storm and wind > Severe wind	Yes	High	Medium		Emergency services; Energy; Information & communications technology; Public health		Increasing	Increasing			High winds are defined as those that last longer than one hour at greater than 39 miles per hour (mph) or for any length of time at greater than 57 mph. They are the most frequent type of severe weather in the City. Windstorms that affect Los Angeles County, notably Santa Ana winds, are not location-specific but rather impact a majority of the area. Santa Ana winds form when a high-pressure region sits over the Great Basin (the high plateau west of the Rockies and east of the Sierra Nevada), forcing air toward the Pacific coast. The air dries and heats up as it descends from the high plateau, creating the warm, dry characteristics of the Santa Ana winds. Severe windstorms pose a significant risk to life and property by creating conditions that disrupt essential systems such as public utilities, telecommunication networks, and transportation routes. High winds can and do occasionally damage homes and businesses. The winds are not considered major widespread threats to population and property but do involve responses from emergency service personnel. Severe windstorms can present a very destabilizing effect on the dry brush that covers local hillsides and wildland-urban interface areas and can increase wildfire threat. Destructive impacts to trees, power lines, and utility services also are associated with high winds. Falling trees can occasionally cause fatalities and serious structural damage while fallen power lines could cause widespread power outages and fire. These incidents are rare and localized.Severe weather, including high winds and thunderstorms, will continue to occur annually in the city. The probability of future occurrences is high. Climate change is anticipated to alter wind patterns and windstorm development. The resulting change is expected to cause an increase in the number of intense storms, which could, in turn, lead to an increase in the frequency of strong winds and other severe weather.

Climate Change has been blamed for changed the way in which the cold polar air is ""sucked"" down to lower latitudes leading to the extremely cold temperatures which can last for a few days. This extreme cold can kill animals, plants and humans. It impacts our built infrastructure in many ways including freezing and breaking built systems, causing power outages and damaging infrastructure. It can also lead to strain on City crews and utility companies that have to work increased hours to ensure vital services are kept online. It can cause social breakdowns by closing work places, schools and other services that may keep people at home."

Evanston has not experienced significant surface flooding beyond the City's sewer system design, but with more intense rainfall in the short and long term the City anticipates this system to be challenged. Because Evanston relies upon a region stormwater utility to treat storm and sewer water Evanston is limited in our mitigation options and strategies. In the future the City anticipates that more intense precipitation will potentially overwhelm the regional system and lead to an increase in overland/surface flooding throughout the City.

Of the potentially affected households, 5,812 households are living in dwelling units of inferior quality.  128 households are living in houses made of makeshift houses. In the event of actual flooding, these exposed population will sustain damages in varying degrees depending on the prevailing demographic characteristics such as age and sex, presence of persons with disabilities, and the like.  Generally, the affected population will experience the following effects:1)Damage to or displacement of shelter. Higher potential damage is expected in rural areas than in urban areas considering the preponderance of housing of light materials in the former. 2) Schooling of children may be hampered especially in rural areas where road conditions could easily render them impassable. 3) Certain segments of the population especially the elderly, the very young, the infirm or persons with disabilities may suffer from greater adverse psycho-social impacts.    Croplands devoted to annual crops like rice and vegetables, as well as livestock and poultry farms and even fishponds are sources of livelihood that easily succumb to flooding.  Farm facilities and machineries including small scale irrigation systems are usually rendered unserviceable.  The local economy is at stand-still in that producers cannot produce, traders cannot sell, financiers cannot collect, the flow of trade is cut-off, capital assets damaged, payment of loans is disrupted and farm calendar is in disarray, among other effects.Sections of major and minor roads and bridges can be rendered impassable, e.g. national road sections in Maoyon, Bacungan, San Rafael, Babuyan, Tagbarungis in Inagawan, Montible, Napsan, and Cabayugan.  Irrigation dams and canals such as the Nabetas dam in San Rafael could possibly be breached. Electric posts and distribution lines could be felled by storms that usually occur with floods.  The site location of the satellite hospital in barangay Salvacion is flood prone.

According to Mines and Geosciences Bureau’s landslide proneness classification, areas that are highly susceptible to landslide are characterized by unstable slope and may face “serious landslide problem”. The “high to medium susceptibility” classifications in mountainous areas are satisfactory considering the steep topographies in those areas. About 7,277 people are living in areas considered as medium to very high susceptible to landslide. The landslide hazard map of MGB, however, makes it appear that all communities in Puerto Princesa City are exposed to landslide classifying even relatively flat areas such as the communities in CBD and Honda Bay as “low susceptible.”1. Possible loss of lives as when persons get buried under debris; 2. Varying physical injuries;  3. Psycho-social trauma of affected individuals;  4. Destruction of houses and other structures;  5.

Tropical Storm Sendong (International Name: Washi) had subjected the Cagayan de Oro river basin to an overwhelming amount of precipitation, causing flooding at the most destructive scale downstream.In its aftermath, TS Sendong had left 674 dead, 199 injured, and 396 missing. A total of 19,952 houses were damaged and 38,125 families had been affected. Damaged infrastructure was estimated at Php 775,000,000, which include major lifeline facilities such as roads and water pipelines.

Most farmers are located in the hinterland barangays to the South and crops vary from banana to corn. This has resulted in the loss of capital for affected farmers, with an adverse effect on their income.Residents with low-quality material housing have also been subject to infrastructure loss on account of high-speed winds tearing off their roofs. Urban residents are also at high risk in the more commercial areas of the city, where some posts or billboards are subject to structural stress in high-speed winds.

This is the season that is expected to have the largest increase of average temperature according to both RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 projection, therefore leaving children and elderly in low-income households in urban areas highly vulnerable. This could result to an increase in heatstroke cases across the general populace, as well as the spread of vectors that spread in intense heat, and could as well drive up the demand for electricity across the City.

The City's major arterial road connecting it to adjacent municipalities and its gateway to nearby cities is mostly affected by rising flood waters in the City center. This results in the suspension of classes and delays in the delivery of goods.Events like the above are expected to increase in frequency as the number of extreme events is amplified by climate change variables. There is also an increase of precipitation especially during the December-January-February season that would aggravate this issue further.

This severe rainfall event resulted in flooding in the following local rivers:• River Faughan estimated total peak flow 5.4 meters• Muff River total peak flow height 3.1 meters• Burndennet River total peak flow height 6.5 metersThis resulted in extensive flooding across the local area with homes, businesses, agriculture, infrastructure, services, heritage and biodiversity adversely affected. The estimated costs to the Department for Infrastructure is in excess of £12  million. Approximately £36,000 was incurred directly by Council on a range of emergency costs (e.g. emergency householder payments, waste disposal costs and clean-up and community centre opening costs). In addition a significant amount of staff time as well as a further £350,000 on capital repair costs to Council assets and facilities was incurred.400 homes & businesses affected5 Bridges washed away & 89 bridges requiring repairA5 closed 3 days210 roads affectedAgriculture affected – livestock drowned, land damage & erosion1,497 calls to Flood Incident LineCity of Derry Airport closed 2 days2,900m flood defences damagedGlenelly Valley Landslides, a 1 in 3,000 year eventNI Flood Maps and climate change projections indicate a increase in flood risk across the city and district.

A nossa cidade é afetada por ciclos de estiagem e secas, em determinadas épocas do ano, e por outro lado, sofre com chuvas torrenciais que provocam inundações em outros períodos.  Dentre as cidades da região do Vale dos Sinos, São Leopoldo é o único município em que o Rio corta zonas densamente habitadas e que historicamente sofrem com inundações devastadoras, por este motivo, foi construído no passado um sistema de proteção contra as cheias do Rio, composta por um conjunto de diques de terra, muros e cortinas de concreto, canais e sistema de bombeamento que protegem grande parte da região central da cidade, 4 bairros da zona sudoeste e  5 bairros da zona norte. Este importante sistema permitiu o crescimento do município, mas por outro lado deixou-o refém de eventos climáticos extremos. Recentemente “Estudo de Alternativas e Projetos para Minimização do Efeito das Cheias na Bacia do Rio dos Sinos” desenvolvidos pela  Fundação Estadual de Planejamento Metropolitano e Regional - METROPLAN apontam para necessidade de medidas complementares em relação a proteção dos municípios da Bacia do Rio dos Sinos em relação proteção frente a eventos climático extremos. O Professor de climatologia do Departamento de Geografia da UFRGS, Francisco Eliseu Aquino, alerta sobre os impactos das mudanças climáticas no Rio Grande do Sul que “Dentro do cenário de mudanças ambientais globais e climáticas, o aumento de temperatura na América do Sul tem contribuído para a formação de chuva mais intensa, por consequência, tempestades, e também ondas de calor, estiagens, secas e ondas de frio. O aumento da temperatura média global tem criado um contraste mais marcado entre a região Antártica e a região Amazônica e a posição do Rio Grande do Sul no caminho – entre as massas de ar frias e as massas de ar quente e úmidas que vêm da região Amazônica ou do trópico... O Estado sempre teve as quatro estações do ano definidas. O que observamos é que a intensidade desses fenômenos está aumentada e, claro, a sequência desses eventos se tornam importantes. O Estado deverá sofrer nas próximas cinco décadas com esses incrementos climáticos.."""

Para Prof. Mariana Lisboa Pessoa “a ocorrência de eventos climáticos extremos — secas, tempestades, enchentes, furacões, ondas de calor e de frio — aumentou muito, em frequência e intensidade, no mundo todo, nos últimos anos, ocasionando impactos negativos para a economia, a sociedade e o meio ambiente. Dentre as tendências para o Rio Grande do Sul, uma é de alteração significativa no regime de precipitação, com períodos prolongados de estiagem, intercalados com outros de grandes volumes de chuvas em um curto espaço de tempo. O déficit hídrico nos períodos de precipitação escassa e os problemas ocasionados pela precipitação intensa (enxurradas, enchentes, alagamentos, deslizamentos e erosão) têm impactos negativos nas áreas tanto urbanas como rurais.” Nos últimos oito anos (2003 a 2010), a Defesa Civil do Rio Grande do Sul registrou a ocorrência de eventos climáticos extremos relacionados à falta ou ao excesso de chuvas, com algum tipo de prejuízo, em 458 municípios do Estado, o que representa mais de 90% do total de municípios gaúchos. Dos municípios atingidos, 20 registraram apenas eventos relacionados ao excesso de chuvas (inundação, enchente, enxurrada e/ou alagamento), 262, somente eventos associados à falta de chuvas (estiagem e/ou exaurimento dos recursos hídricos), e 176 (cerca de 40% do total dos municípios atingidos) apresentaram pelo menos uma ocorrência de cada tipo.

(máxima oficial em 56 anos). Advindo a isto temos todas as implicações sociais e ambientais desta situação e os cuidados que devem ser tomados durante período de calor extremo, com a saúde pública, por exemplo, especial com pessoas idosas ou de saúde fragilizada, desidratações, doenças oportunistas e ainda riscos ligados ao índices de radiação UV que são muito altos em calor extremo, por outro lado a diminuição do rendimento no trabalho, maior gasto energético e financeiro com conforto térmico, risco de incêndios. Além de impactar diretamente a produção agrícola, a economia e a disponibilidade de recursos.

Para el primer caso las personas afectadas deben salir de los lugares que por algún tiempo fueron ocupados y donde establecieron un arraigo por el lugar, estas familias en ocasiones son reubicadas en vivienda de interés social  construidas y adjudicadas por la administración municipal, pero que en ocasiones se localizan a los extremos de la ciudad, por lo que deben abandonar su estilo de vida y demás aspectos culturales que ya habían establecido, sin contar las nuevas  condiciones de vida a las que son expuestos.  Para el segundo caso el gobierno local debe  establecer un rubro considerable para atender las emergencias presentadas en el municipio  lo que en ocasiones genera que se reduzca los recursos tendientes al conocimiento y reducción del riesgo que evitarían de alguna manera la ocurrencia de emergencias.

The Peruvian coast withstands high temperatures that not only cause damage to the skin if there is not adequate protection and that could cause some people to suffer heat strokes, but this can also occur if the body temperature reaches 40 ° C or more, without having any disease or infection. Specialists recommend that people take precautions such as: avoiding exposure to sunlight between 10 and 3 p.m. when ultraviolet light is more intense and does more damage to the skin. Also wear sunscreen, sunglasses, wide-brimmed hats, loose-fitting cotton clothing, and keep homes and workplaces ventilated.  Drink plenty of water (6 to 8 glasses a day) to avoid dehydration. If pollution levels continue to rise, the temperature will likely increase and heat waves will increase their temperature making San Borja an impassable district at certain times of the day.

The Rio Surco crosses 17 districts before flowing into the Pacific Ocean. In recent years the board of irrigators of Rio Surco has been having problems with the increased flow of the river due to the fact that rainfall in the upper basin of the Rio Rimac has not been occurring normally and has decreased the flow destined for the Rio Surco channel. This has resulted in the district's green areas not being maintained in optimum condition. By now, the Surco River Chanel has not flooded. In case this would happen the San Borja Municipality has a staff trained to act immediately.

Es importante tener en cuenta que el consumo solo refleja a aquellos que tienen medidor, como se sabe, en Lima la casi la tercera parte de habitantes carece de conexión domiciliariaEquilibrar el incremento de la demanda de recursos hídricos con la sostenibilidad del planeta es uno de los principales retos a los que se enfrenta la humanidad en las próximas décadas. Ante esta necesidad, se han desarrollado diferentes metodologías, enfoques e indicadores para evaluar los impactos del uso de agua dulce. La aplicación del concepto de huella hídrica ha sido un paso importante en esa dirección. (Kumar & Azapagic: Water footprint: methodologies an a case study for assessing the impacts. Journal of Cleaner Production. Abril 2011)Según la Superintendencia Nacional de Servicios de Saneamiento – SUNASS, la ciudad de Lima Metropolitana generó la mitad de las aguas servidas producidas en el Perú, de ese volumen, solo se trató el 51.25% cifra que ha venido en aumento en los últimos años para mitigar la contaminación de las aguas en los cauces de ríos y desembocadura al litoral.La Municipalidad de San Isidro ha realizado el cálculo de su Huella hídrica, tanto a nivel distrital como institucional, como una herramienta para la toma de decisiones que le permita reducir el impacto y mejorar la eficiencia en el uso de este recurso: 106´116,330.7m3 (Año 2015).

En el tema de gestión de residuos, el sistema de recolección que actualmente se practica es la recolección domiciliaria,  la que se realiza en horario nocturno debido a la dinámica del Distrito (que es muy comercial de dia), con el calor los residuos tienden a descomponerse de manera mas rápida,ocasionando la presencia de vectores, es necesario facilitar el almacenamiento temporal a través de contenedores que sean seguros y que se adapten a las condiciones de la ciudad.

El ancho de las playas es variable a lo largo de las 9 playas, las cuales mayormente son de piedras de canto rodado de un ancho promedio de 5 a 10 metros, después de lo cual mayormente hay una berma con palmeras y vereda de 2 metros de ancho, subsecuentemente se encuentra la autopista denominada Costanera con tres carriles que van en sentido Norte a Sur y Sur a Norte. Es decir que la distancia entre la orilla y la base del acantilado fluctúa entre los 30 y los 100 metros.

Este peligro podría co-beneficiarse con las olas de calor ya que al haber sequias se pierden las áreas verdes que ayudan a disminuir el calor del ambiente y toda medida que ayude conservar las áreas verdes, estaría contribuyendo como medida de adaptación a estos peligros.Las áreas verdes se verían afectadas debido al estrés hídrico que se presentaría, lo que tendría una pérdida de la cubierta vegetal, lo que aumentaría la sensación térmica en el distrito.En Perú, los efectos del fenómeno ""El Niño"" se intensifican debido al cambio climático, causando inundaciones aluviales violentas como resultado del desbordamiento de los ríos que causan un gran entierro en su camino.Las avalanchas o deslizamientos de tierras (huaycos) son un peligro indirecto para el distrito; sin embargo este se encuentra altamente relacionado con la sequía, ya que afectan el suministro de servicios de agua potable para consumo humano y para el riego de áreas verdes; afectando seriamente la dinámica del distrito y el deterioro de las áreas verdes debido al estrés hídrico"

Esto sumado a la ubicación de barlovento, en las épocas frías en mayo a agosto, las precarias casas sufren con los vientos fuertes que se originan en la zona por la baja presión de la época, y por la ubicación en barlovento de las casas. Lo que pone en riesgo a los habitantes, en especial a niños y ancianos, pobladores de la zona.

Otros factores que contribuyen a la baja temperatura son la humedad elevada por las lloviznas y neblinas, además como el comportamiento del Anticiclón del Pacífico Sur, sistema climático que al acercarse al continente hace que los vientos se acerquen al litoral y genera gran nubosidad más allá de la línea costera. La temperatura del mar está relacionada directamente con la temperatura del aire, por tanto, si esta desciende, la del ambiente también bajará, en ese sentido en Lima y Callao, los termómetros han registrado temperaturas de hasta 12,6 grados en los 2 últimos años (2017 – 2018). En zonas como Pachacutec en el norte de la provincia se incrementan las enfermedades respiratorias, de igual forma en la zona sur  que reciben la mayor incidencia de vientos de sur a norte y que geográficamente se encuentran mas expuestas.

Asimismo el calor motiva a que los pobladores acudan a playas del litoral e instalen piscina en áreas públicas, exponiéndose a enfermedades  producidas  por  vectores,  tales  como  los  mosquitos  que  producen  las enfermedades tales como: el chicunguña, zika y dengue.

Precisando que en febrero del año 2017 hubo escasez de agua potable debido al fenómeno del Niño Costero.Respecto a la cobertura vegetativa se requiere para el riego un total de 7,333 m3 del líquido vital, diario para el riego de áreas verdes, sin embargo obtenemos un promedio de 4,148.91 m3 de aguas tratadas para riego en nuestras plantas de tratamiento de aguas residuales,  estableciéndose  un déficit de 51.88 % que se cubre con agua potable.Puntos importantes referentes serían:-la sequia tanto en costa como en sierra afecta a todos, reduce el aprovisionamiento de agua, de alimentos, de energía-las enfermedades gastrointestinales aumentan, por la escasez de agua.-desorden publico por acceso al agua, por cuanto no se cuenta con otras fuentes de agua suficientes, no hay reservorios suficientes

Las aguas del río Rímac, principal abastecedor de agua de la capital, se salieron de su cauce inundando las instalaciones de las empresas estatales Petroperú, y ENAFER (Empresa Nacional de Ferrocarriles) y la Base Naval del Callao, así como humildes urbanizaciones aledañas.El desborde del río afectó a unas 15.000 personas que viven en sus riberas y testigos declararon a la prensa sobre la muerte de una anciana y un niño. Los barrios pobres afectados parcialmente fueron Nestor Gambetta, Mariscal Ramón Castilla, que tiene 33 comités vecinales, Dulanto, Cáceres, y Puerto Nuevo, según las autoridades. Varias de las personas damnificadas fueron reubicadas en la parroquia católica Nuestra Señora del Rosario, cercana al lugar.Las causas de la crecida del río fueron las intensas lluvias en la sierra del Perú, donde también se registraron graves inundaciones, deslizamientos y derrumbes de cerros. Caminos, carreteras, puentes, así como cientos de viviendas, figuran en el balance provisional de destrucción material que causó el fenómeno natural. Una filmación de la Defensa Civil, transmitida por la televisión peruana, mostró totalmente inundadas dos plantas de petróleo, ubicadas en el Puerto, una de la empresa holandesa Shell y otra de la estatal peruana Petro Perú, cuyos trabajadores fueron evacuados, se exhibió un sector de la Base Naval de El Callao, también inundado, en donde se podía apreciar que una decena de buses y algunas instalaciones estaban cubiertos por el agua.Las autoridades peruanas informaron que el terminal terrestre del puerto también fue afectado por la inundación. Las pérdidas superaron los dos millones de dólares, según un balance oficial.

In addition, the increased wildfires, like Paradise, in the Bay Area have already impacted the air quality of Piedmont.

According to the City General Plan, the local effects of sea level rise could be severe in Emeryville. Historic records show that sea level in San Francisco Bay Area has risen by 6 feet in the past century.  The San Francisco Bay Area Conservation and Development Commission (BCDC) projects a 16 inches sea level rise scenario by the mid of this century.Some of Emeryville's assets are expected to be inundated by sea level rise , either temporarily or permanently, once the once the increase in water level reaches 24 inches, which is possible by 20150. At this point water begins encroaching beyond the natural buffer of the shoreline and begins to reach shoreline park and three commercial buildings, two storm sewer lines and a streetlight on the peninsula. At 36 inches of sea level rise , which is likely by the end of the century, the water levels reach marina facilities, culverts and sewers, 2 restaurants, the Emeryville Marina Office building, five parks, and another streetlight. The parks at Davenport Mini Park, Shorebird Park, Marina Park, Point Emery Park, and McLaughlin Eastshore State Park. At 48 inches, likely by the end of the century when combined with average yearly storm surge, water threatens five buildings along  the peninsula shoreline, the floods Powell St between Anchor Drive and Admiral Drive, cutting off transport to the marina. Other flooded assets include tow additional streetlights, two additional gravity main storm sewer lines, two storm sewer manholes, two pipelines and the railroad tracks south of Emeryville, which would prevent rail traffic from passing through the area. Westbound access to the Bay Bridge will also be prohibited under these conditions.The critical transition between manageable and devastating flooding is between 48 and 72 inches of inundation for Emeryville. With predicted end-of-century sea level rise compounded by glacial melting and/or King tides and storm surge, there is the possibility that the Bay Area will experience sea rise related flooding at or above these levels.

Emeryville has a number of sites that had been susceptible to floods, such as the areas east of the Southern Pacific railroad tracks, including the Hollis St business areas and the Federal Post Office property. Low lying areas affected by the tidal and high winds have been and are susceptible to damage and flooding in the west peninsula shoreline area. Prior to 1963, periodic flooding and erosion occurred along Temescal Creek resulting  in extensive property damage. The floodplain of the creek was then incorporated into Alameda County Flood Zone 12, most of the length of the creek was put into an underground culvert, and a deeper and wider concrete channel was constructed to contain the 100-year flood level. On February 25th, 2004, the City experienced a winter storm which caused flooding at a magnitude that has not been seen recent history. The storm generated a rain event with an intensity of at least a 25 year design storm, combined with high tide. Emeryville's Drainage Basin 27 had streets that were flooded to depths of greater than 2 feet. The streets impacted were LaCoste St, 62nd, Overland Drive and the 64th which included the Emeryville Post Office on 62nd St. On January 20, 2010, the City again experienced flooding, conditions on the above referenced streets, although not as severe conditions as in 2004. To mitigate any future flooding in this area,  the Alameda County Flood Control District working with the City, designed a new flood control bypass system to alleviate the flooding  on the above mentioned streets. This new underground system called for new connections to the existing drainage system to pipe storm water off the streets and into San Francisco Bay. Construction for the project cost 8.5 mil and was completed in November 2010. This area has not suffered any flooding since the completion of this project. Impacts from seasonal flooding  could include water intrusion into homes and businesses and streets becoming impassible and damaged due to flooding.

In 2100, Emeryville will experience  6-10 additional heat waves each year which will disproportionally impact the elderly, children under 5, and the low income members of our community. Currently, homeless, low-income populations and the elderly are  especially at risk. A large portion of the older housing stock does not have air conditioning and the higher  temperatures can be lethal  especially for the elderly and the disabled who often times are confined to their homes.  Besides, high temperatures are often associated with poor air quality (extended days for the ""Spare the air alerts""). Low air quality poses high risk to children and adults suffering from asthma and other respiratory diseases. Subsequently,  during such heat waves periods have been registered high numbers of 911 calls and ER visits."

In 2014, the Governor declared  a state of emergency in California in response to the drought conditions which began in 2012.  The year 2015 surpassed 1977 as the driest year on record in California. In June 2015, statewide reservoirs were at only 18-65% average. Although, the winter of 2016 eased drought conditions that the Governor ended the state of emergency in April 2017,  2017/2018 winter saw a less than average rainfall for Emeryville and the Bay Area. . However, the 2018-2019 winter has proved to be an abnormal year for rain. These being said, climate change is likely to increase the number and severity of future droughts. The cumulative impact of climate change will result in drier conditions for the entire City of Emeryville and could alter the timing and efficiency  of the Bay Area water supply.

Precipitation has increased by 15 percent over the past century. Severe rain events saturate the ground causing tree, building and infrastructure damage. Heavy rain events also can negatively impact  water resources through increasing agricultural runoff as well as river floods and flash floods. Future projections show occurrence of downpours to be uneven throughout the year but also are expected to be more frequent. This uneven distribution alters water quantity and its availability for farmers as well as overburdening the city's combined stormwater/sewer system. Intense rain events lead to urban flooding in residential basements as well as in the streets inducing damage and hardship. Individuals, families and businesses serving vulnerable populations are especially at risk from the impacts of severe rain events. Beyond the built environment’s damage from severe rain there is the possibility of increased health issues brought about from rain events especially from contact with stormwater or wastewater which has been correlated with gastrointestinal illnesses, and an standing water that leads to an increase in mosquitoes.

In addition to extensive damage to public and private property, this can also become a health hazard because of increased indoor mold, increased unprocessed sewage discharged to St. Joseph River or basements, and increased populations of waterborne pests like mosquitoes. Floods after heavy rains in 2015 washed out numerous public streets, collapsed basements, and required multiple rescue operations, requiring financial and personnel resources to be diverted from basic public services.  We expect the hazards experienced in the past to inform priority needs relative to how the city's Long Term Control Plan is executed especially in the prioritization of projects that will allow the city to mitigate surface flooding issues while addressing the health and wellness needs of vulnerable populations and resources/businesses that serve them. The city is committed to a Long Term Control Plan and heavy use of green stormwater infrastructure and smart cities technology that will minimize sewage discharge and help flood-prone areas mitigate or adapt.

Also, when the river level exceeds that of streets, water flows into the combined sewer system and mixed sewage backs up into residential basements. The unprecedented rainfall events have caused severe damage to city infrastructure and businesses and homes. The St. Joseph River crested at a history 12.7 feet in February of 2019.The city suffered flood damage to five pedestrian trails and its water filtration systems North Pumping Station in Leeper Park. The waste water treatment plant was inundated and had to shut down, with collected sewage bypassing the plant and directly discharged to the river. The city already has spent about $157,400 to remove flood debris, stabilize the river’s banks, and repair pumps and electrical systems.The impact of that single river flooding event led to the damage of nearly 2,000 homes across the region. Residents of Northshore Triangle neighborhood were hit hard from a river flooding event in 2018. New measures have been implemented with the  support of new and or deepened partnerships with private engineering firms and federal assistance. Backwater gates for example will be attached to the end of stormwater outfall pipes, preventing the river from backing up into sewer pipes when river levels increase ($100,000).South Bend is also partnering with U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for the installation of real-time river gauges for remote viewing of floodway mapping ($222,000). A redirection of stormwater project is being assessed specifically for the neighborhood of Northshore Triangle. Finally the city has adopted two new approaches for communicating river flooding events with the public. During flooding events Public Works takes over the city's homepage to communicate with the public using maps, and information regarding preparation or resources. The department also recently joined NextDoor, the app that notifies subscribing residents by email and text, with plans to use it to quickly provide flood information to people.Indiana Climate Change Impacts Assessment provides projections of future conditions for St. Joseph County.  https://ag.purdue.edu/indianaclimate/indiana-climate-report

While it is not uncommon for the temperature to exceed 37°C in the summer statewide annual average temperatures have increased by 1.2°F since 1895, and are projected to continue rising. Excessive heat and humidity negatively affects air quality, and increases the occurrence of heat-related health issues like dehydration or heat stroke, which particularly affects the elderly, children, those with chronic health conditions, and those without air conditioning in homes – these four groups make up a relatively large proportion of South Bend’s population.  Residents who live without air conditioning may also find themselves seeking alternative cooling locations for relief. The City and other partners are responsible for costs of cooling centers and shelters. Those that are without a vehicle are exposed to being outdoors waiting on public transportation thus are also seen as a vulnerable population as it relates to extreme heat. The cost of cooling homes and businesses will also increase considerably as it takes more and more energy to maintain a comfortable indoor climate.

However, residents of South Bend, and public systems, are well-adapted to heavy snows. Snow is influenced by weather systems as well as the hydrology of nearby Lake Michigan. Heavy snowfall is projected to be incrementally replaced with rain as regional temperatures continue to rise. Indiana winters are unpredictable. The entire city of South Bend is affected by heavy snow causing a myriad of issues especially for commuters. Road closures from heavy snow are common as well as power loss due to downed lines from heavy snowfall on adjacent trees. Power outages for the region has in the past swelled to nearly 20,000 homes in the Michiana region as in the storm of November 2018. School closures impact the 18,110 students resulting in loss of school days. The School Board has however initiated e-learning days so that students are able to continue their learning and work from home during climate events. Our disabled population under 65 is a little over 12,000 residents with the elderly population over the age of 65 being approximately 13,000 residents. These individuals are at a greater risk of immobility and access when heavy snowfall occurs.  Transpo buses may abandon or detour some routes. South Bends local businesses slow down in sales during heavy snowfall as well. Predictions show much more of a mix of rain and snow in future winters. This has its own risks. Destructive flooding in February 2018 was caused by rapid increase in temperature melting 18+ inches of snow already on the ground, which saturated the ground, followed by a moderately heavy rainstorm which was unable to be absorbed. Swings in precipitation also negatively impact revenue from in-town and nearby snow sports such as ice skating, cross country skiing, tubing, and downhill skiing.

Heat is the number one cause of weather-related injuries and fatalities in the region. In 2019, 53 days at or above 90°F and 13 days at or above 95°F were recorded at Dulles International Airport. Across the region, Equity Emphasis Areas (EEAs) - areas with concentrations of low-income, minority populations or both - are more heavily burdened by extreme heat. The median number of extreme heat days a year in the region is 8.61 days, the median in EEAs is 8.75 days. Potentially vulnerable populations may face barriers such as access to air conditioning, housing, and cooling centers. Populations that rely on electronic medical devices and refrigerated medication face a greater risk during power outages from extreme heat days. Populations that reside in urban areas, are more at risk due to urban heat island effects. The number of extreme heat days will increase by 2025, with both extreme heat days and heat waves occurring more frequently. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Climate Explorer data indicates a significant increase in the projected number of heat days; that the number of days per year with temperatures above 95°F may reach more than 50 to 100 days by 2065 under the high emissions scenario.  Extreme heat presents challenges to infrastructure. Extreme heat can lead to more frequent travel disruptions, increased road surface damage and pavement softening, increase in rail infrastructure deterioration from buckling and expansion, impact aviation runways and plane takeoff, and impact electrical infrastructure (i.e. sagging lines). An increase in the number of extreme heat days may accelerate deterioration of other assets such as buildings, bridges, and vegetation, and increase cost of maintenance. Increased days of extreme heat can also lead to higher ozone pollution levels and could make it more difficult for the region to attain or maintain attainment with National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone. High heat, unhealthy air days can trigger heat stroke, respiratory problems, heat exhaustion, hyperthermia, and death. The elderly, small children, persons with chronic diseases, persons with allergies, low-income populations, and outdoor workers are especially vulnerable to heat-related illnesses.

Drought can cause dry weather patterns, low water supply, and can affect agricultural crops. While upstream reservoirs provide some protection from drought for metropolitan Washington, the region is particularly at risk due to the heavy reliance on the Potomac River as the primary source of potable water. Some jurisdictions are 100 percent reliant on water withdrawals from the Potomac River. Conditions in the Potomac River Basin frequently differ between the upper and lower portions of the Basin. Drought has a moderate probability of occurring but has a high consequence of impact in the region on the water supply and agricultural systems.Although droughts account for a small percentage of hazards in the region, impacts can be severe. In September 2010, due to unusually dry conditions, Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments' (COG) Drought Coordination Committee (DCC) declared a drought ‘WATCH”; The WATCH ended when Tropical Storm Nicole hit the region. Since 2000, several smaller community water systems have briefly declared WARNING or EMERGENCY stages due to limited rainfall and less resilient water supply systems. In October 2019, The October 1, 2019 U.S. Drought Monitor for the Potomac Watershed indicated that abnormal dryness (D0) and moderate drought (D1) exist throughout the region due to an unusually hot and dry September.By 2050, droughts may occur more frequently and be prolonged, with an increased intensity. As most of the region’s drinking water comes from the free-flowing Potomac River, more frequent and intense droughts may increase the demand of water, lower base flows in the Potomac River watershed, and degrade water quality. The food and agriculture sector may face reduced crop yield and crop losses. Vulnerable populations are at a high risk, due to the indirect impacts of the disruptions of agriculture and water systems.

The region has experienced many flash and riverine flooding events. In 2006, Washington D.C., experienced several days of intense rainfall, equivalent to a 200-year storm. The precipitation overwhelmed the storm sewer system. Several Federal agencies, museums, and the Metro transit system had severe impacts to their operations, buildings, and infrastructure. In addition to damages to infrastructure and businesses, the event caused disruptions to critical services. A couple other notable examples of flash and riverine include May 2018 flash flooding in Frederick and July 2019 flash flooding in Northern Virginia.   The frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation events are likely to increase. Projections show precipitation will occur at a higher range than historical records, demonstrating the possibility of more frequent heavy precipitation events. A 100-year precipitation event could become a one in 25-year event by mid-century, and a one in 15-year event by the 2080's. An increase in the number and intensity of flash and riverine flooding may cause disruptions to the transportation and energy sector including flooding roadways, physical damages, loss and disruption to critical and emergency services, and wide-scale power outages. Sewer systems may be damaged due to the overwhelming level of water and pollution from storm water runoff may increase a degradation of water quality and shoreline loss. Individuals with lower socioeconomic status and unemployed persons are more likely to have limited resources that may hinder their ability to prepare for flooding and evacuate before and during an event. Persons with disabilities, the elderly, persons with chronic conditions, and language barriers are also at risk during flood events. Persons residing in flood zones are at risk for loss of property and injuries. Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) 100-year floodplains run through more than 60% of Equity Emphasis Areas (EEAs) - areas with concentrations of low-income, minority populations or both - where currently approximately 1 million people reside. Also notable, is that more than half of the region’s EEAs are within the Anacostia watershed.

Coastal flooding poses risks to transportation services, infrastructure, residential housing, businesses, and the economy.In the past 90 years, the Potomac and Anacostia River, both tidal rivers have experienced 11 inches of sea level rise. Nuisance flooding has increased over 300 percent along the riverfront. Effects of sea level rise are observable, including shoreline erosion and deterioration of tidal wetlands. Recent examples of coastal flood events include impacts of Hurricane Isaac (2003), the 2006 Mid-Atlantic Storm and Tropical Storm Lee (2011).   The region may experience more intense and more frequent coastal flooding impacts. The District of Columbia could experience 2 to 6 feet of additional sea level rise towards the end of the century. Increases in sea level rise will cause tidal and nuisance floods with more severe impacts and a reduction of time in between floods. Storm surge floods will be more threatening in the long term with added sea level rise.  Coastal areas in metropolitan Washington contain a critical convergence of infrastructure (water, energy, and communication utilities, transportation hubs, facilities and buildings) that the region’s local governments, businesses, institutions, and communities depend upon. The region is also home to many federal buildings, military installations, national security facilities, and significant national monuments and cultural treasures. As sea level rises, the coastline may change and critical infrastructure that was previously not at risk may face a greater risk of flooding from storm surges. More frequent and intense coastal flooding may impact these infrastructure and facilities potentially causing damage, disruptions, and economic losses.Coastal flooding puts vulnerable populations that live and work near the coast at a higher risk. Populations with socioeconomic barriers and individuals with language barriers face greater challenges to prepare and respond to flood events.  More than 10 percent of EEAs will be affected by a 6-foot sea level rise. More than 100,000 people currently live in these EEAs.

Millions of people experienced power outages for several days during a heatwave. The Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission (WSSC) experienced power loss at Potomac and Patuxent filtration plants and at more than 50 of its facilities. Transportation routes were blocked due to downed trees and power lines. The Derecho event resulted in communication infrastructure damages and 9-1-1 outages affected more than 1.5 million people in Northern Virginia and 68,000 people in the District of Columbia. In October 2012, the region experienced sustained winds and heavy rain during Superstorm Sandy. Impacts were lessened due the region not being directly hit, pre-landfall preparedness, and coordination during response and recovery operations. During Sandy, the region experienced flooding, power outages, downed power lines and trees. Water utilities experienced short power outages, flooding, or sewer overflows.  Metrorail and bus services were suspended for two days.  Severe thunderstorms and lightning have a high probability to occur more frequently by 2025. Future projections show the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events are projected to increase from 10 days per year with 1 inch of rain in a 24-hour period to 12 days by 2050. The number of days per year with more than 2 inches of rainfall per 24-hour period is expected to increase from 1 day to  3.5 days by the 2050s.  More frequent and intense severe storms will cause additional impacts to energy, transportation, water, and communication services and assets. Power outages and transportation disruptions will occur due to extreme rainfall events and downed trees. Severe thunderstorms and lightning pose a public health challenge, as power outages can disrupt medical services and emergency response. More intense rainfall can damage and overwhelm water infrastructure. Long-term power outages pose challenges to potentially vulnerable populations including the elderly, persons with chronic conditions, persons who rely on electric medical equipment and refrigerated medication. Prolonged power outages can become life threatening during heat waves and extreme cold events.

Extreme winter conditions have a moderate probability and a high consequence, as these events pose a life-threatening risk to human health and life.The region has experienced extreme winter conditions resulting in loss of life, significant economic impacts, and infrastructure damages. Recent winter storms events affecting metropolitan Washington include: Snowzilla (2016), Carmageddon (2011), Snowmageddon (2010), and Snowpocalypse (2009). The February 2010 severe winter storm named Snowmageddon impacted the Atlantic coastline, dropping several feet of snow in metropolitan Washington.  Washington's Dulles Airport recorded 32.4 inches of snow. A State of Emergency was declared in Washington D.C, Virginia, and Maryland. Widespread power outages occurred with hundreds of thousands without power. The Federal government and schools in the region were closed for several days. Infrastructure damages and disruptions to transportation routes occurred due to excessive snow on roadways, downed trees, abandoned vehicles and vehicle accidents. It took several days to clear roads and pedestrian paths after the storm.Extreme winter conditions will occur more frequently and increase in intensity by 2025. While average annual temperatures are increasing, extreme winter events and cold snaps may continue to occur. Extreme winter conditions cause impacts to both infrastructure and people. Infrastructure can experience road surface damages and closures resulting in travel disruptions and higher maintenance costs. Roadway accidents, injuries, and fatalities are likely to coincide with winter conditions. Energy infrastructure may experience transmission structure failures resulting in power outages for many customers. Extreme cold temperatures pose a public health risk especially to persons facing homelessness, low-income households, the elderly, and persons with chronic conditions who rely on daily access to services.

Projected temperatures are based on Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP)11.  Saratoga County’s Department of Health has now compared two RCP scenarios: 1) RCP 4.511, an intermediate emission scenario in a future with relatively ambitious emissions reductions and stabilization after 2100, and 2) RCP 8.511, a high emission scenario representing a future with no policy changes to reduce emissions.  Both scenarios predict an increase in average temperatures, with a much greater increase under the high emission scenario in comparison to intermediate emission scenario. (NYS Department of Health: Saratoga County Heat-Health Profile Report).Heat waves have caused economic impacts in Saratoga Springs. In 2018, NYRA closed  the Race Track due to a heat wave which caused the loss of economic activity associated with the short horse racing season. In addition, each summer there are a number of heat related deaths of horses. Also, heat waves impact seniors and low income communities who struggle to pay for cooling their homes.

It is uncertain how the annual number of Atlantic tropical storms will change over the 21st century. All else equal, tropical cyclone surge levels should increase with sea level rise as projected for example by IPCC AR5. These assessment statements are intended to apply to climate warming of the type projected for the 21st century by prototype IPCC mid-range warming scenarios, such as A1B or RCP4.5.

Currently and in the past saltwater intrusion has caused the County wellfields (2A, 3A/B) and Cities of Deerfield Beach, Pompano Beach, Hollywood and Dania Beach to shut down wells and construct new wells further west away from the ocean and intruding saltwater front. Hollywood has also pursued reverse osmosis treatment of brackish Floridan Aquifer water as an alternative to their traditional Biscayne Aquifer supply that is being impacted by saltwater intrusion. Although many of these Cities have better managed their coastal withdrawals to prolong the use of eastern wells, increasing sea level will continue to push the saltwater front further inland and may compromised additional wells. Many cities will be forced to move wells further west if their city boundaries permit or they will have to come to agreements with neighboring Cities or regional facilities to obtain raw water in order to meet growing demands.

A mapping exercise conducted by the Planning and Redevelopment Division indicated areas at risk of tidal flooding due to sea level rise east of the salinity control structures will be substantially affecting households, businesses and property values. Nearly 2000 homes and 200 businesses in eastern Broward would be impacted by a one foot rise in sea level. With a two foot rise, the impact is multiplied 5-6 times with property loss increasing from an estimated loss at one foot sea level rise of $469M to $4.54B. The three foot scenario shows impacts to 11% of the population, 12% of the workforce with 17.5% loss in total taxable value. The inundation models show that the cost of inaction would be tremendous.Local impacts related to climate change, especially sea level rise, are already occurring. Critical public infrastructure including beaches, roadways and especially stormwater drainage treatment and conveyance systems have already begun to show vulnerabilities to the current rate of rise of sea level, extreme rainfall and seasonal high tides. Coastal communities have begun to seek infrastructure improvements to address mounting drainage concerns. The predicted accelerated rate of sea level rise will further exacerbate the impact of saltwater intrusion on our source of drinking water and on coastal habitats. Climate-related challenges currently exist suggesting action to address these issues is needed today."

These estimates show that the impacts from coastal flooding would increase over time. Currently, coastal flooding impacts the overall drainage system. While the City is updating its stormwater management system with new pump stations, the old system is still gravity driven.  These older systems lead to slow drainage from streets which may cause extended flooding in streets and properties. As the City continues to update its stormwater management system, using the Unified Sea Level Rise Projection for planning, it is expected that there should be a reduced impact from coastal flooding.

Flash/surface flooding impacts the overall drainage system. While the City is updating its stormwater management system with new pump stations, the old system is gravity driven. This leads to slow drainage from streets which may cause extended flooding in streets and properties and stormwater system requirements. The City is updating its stormwater management system to address these needs and adapt to the increasing effects of climate change.

City has just completed the first fully integrated low impact design stormwater management (green infrastructure) project in the State of Louisiana.  Additionally the City has just been identified as a Silver Jackets recipient through the US Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a comprehensive watershed vulnerability analysis that will also scope priority projects to utilize up to $10,000,000 through their Continuing Authorities Program authorization.

The City has the same structural vulnerabilities as the City of New Orleans, and without effective preventative maintenance of levee system and investment in added protection from ""natural"" (coastal/deltaic land building projects) or man made systems (levees, pump stations, etc.), the City will have heightened vulnerability.  Though because we are a coastal city bound by the Mississippi River, vulnerability will always be present.  Still, maintenance of existing levee  and added protection of existing flood protection systems is critical."

Heating systems compensate for the cold outside.  Most people limit their time outside during extreme cold conditions, but common complaints usually include pipes freezing and cars refusing to start.  When cold temperatures and wind combine, dangerous wind chills can develop.  The dangers associated with extreme cold include frostbite and hypothermia. Between 2009 and 2017, there were six (6) extreme cold/wind chill events for Cuyahoga County, Ohio which have resulted in $200,000 in property damage. There have been no recorded deaths or injuries from extreme cold/wind chill events. Another cause of extreme cold events in Cuyahoga County is polar vortexes. They have affected our County several times within the last decade. This can cause several days with negative temperatures and high winds. We are anticipating that Cuyahoga County will continue to experience extreme cold in the future.

Since 1996, there have been 69 winter weather events according to NOAA, most of which have caused significant damage to property. According to NOAA, there have been 74 injuries and no deaths. The total amount of property damage done by winter storm events equates to a total of $17,770,000. All County assets can be considered at risk from severe winter storms. This includes 100 percent of the County population and all buildings and infrastructure. Damages primarily occur as a result of cold temperatures, heavy snow or ice and sometimes strong winds.  Due to their regular occurrence, these storms are considered hazards only when they result in damage to specific structures or cause disruption to traffic, communications, electric power, or other utilities. A winter storm can adversely affect roadways, utilities, business activities, and can cause loss of life, frostbite and freezing conditions.The freezing and thaw cycle throughout the winter can also have an impact on infrastructure. We anticipate that extreme winter weather will continue to occur in the future.

En noviembre de 2001, se registró una precipitación de 900 mm, valor cercano a la media anual (1100-1150 mm). Como consecuencia, el quebranto agropecuario para esa época alcanzó los U$S 50.000.000. Entre el 1 de junio y el 31 de diciembre de 2014 se declaró, en la RES. 44/2015 MAGP, estado de emergencia y/o desastre agropecuario por inundaciones para el municipio de Chacabuco. Otra importante inundación tuvo lugar durante el año 2015, cuando las viviendas, los caminos y los animales fueron los primeros perjudicados, además, varias familias fueron evacuadas.A futuro, además, como resultado del cambio climático habría una tendencia en Chacabuco hacia mayores valores de la precipitación anual acumulada en eventos de precipitación intensa que haría que el riesgo de ocurrencia aumente, así mismo como la intensidad de los eventos.

Además, los aumentos de temperatura proyectados en la temperatura mínima media y en la máxima media son muy similares (1°C). Las noches con temperaturas en exceso de 20°C (noches tropicales) aumentarían entre 10 y 15 días. De acuerdo con las proyecciones de temperatura, es de esperar también que el número de días con olas de calor aumente. En efecto, el aumento de días en el año con olas de calor sería de entre 10 y 15 días.Este tipo de eventos, además de poner en riesgo a la salud pública, aumentan la demanda de energía eléctrica y dificultan la calidad en la prestación de los servicios públicos.

Se encuentra además en las vías de escurrimiento de bajos compuestos por lagunas semipermanentes. Particularmente la Provincia de Santa Fe  atraviesa una situación muy crítica respecto de inundaciones. El nivel freático aumenta debido a que el agua expulsada hacia la atmósfera en forma de evapotranspiración se ve disminuida a lo largo de los años por los cultivos que sólo persisten una parte del año y además, por no sembrar cultivos de cobertura invernales.  Esto, sumado a las canalizaciones realizadas por sectores más altos de la cuenca, hace que  el nivel freático aumente, lo que está causando una gran disminución de hectáreas aptas para el cultivo y una mayor probabilidad de inundaciones. Particularmente, las inundaciones del casco urbano se centralizaron en una vía de escurrimiento. Esta realidad ocasiona serios problemas de anegamiento cuando ocurren eventos pluviales de mediana y alta magnitud.Los aportes provenientes de la zona rural desde unos 2 kilómetros al oeste del ejido urbano, han generado ingreso de agua a viviendas en los últimos años.

Se observa que, enla región ocupada por San Carlos Sud, la precipitación media anual, que oscilaentre 850 y 1000 mm, presentó un incremento significativo de aproximadamente100 mm.Así mismo, dicha figura muestra los cambios proyectados según los modelosclimáticos para el futuro cercano (2015-2039) considerando un escenario deemisiones altas (RCP 8.5). En este caso, se espera un incremento pocorelevante de la precipitación media anual (0-10 mm por año) y se espera unincremento considerable de la precipitación diaria máxima de entre 6 y 8 mm(Figura 17.a).Además, como resultado del cambio climático las proyecciones indican unatendencia en San Carlos Sur hacia mayores valores de la precipitación anualacumulada en eventos de precipitación intensa (Figura 17.b), con valores que seencuentran entre 50 y 75 mm.Consecuencias: -Pérdida de rendimiento de actividades productivas.-En espacios públicos se registraron caídas de dos ejemplares  en el año 2018 y muchas ramas, dado que las ráfagas de viento fueron elevadas.

Sin embargo, el modelo de producción predominante condiciona la salud edáfica, sobre todo intensificando dos procesos interrelacionados: la pérdida de materia orgánica y la erosión hídrica. Por un lado, en el transporte de sedimentos producido en el proceso de erosión se produce la pérdida de las partículas, entre ellas gran parte de la materia orgánica y los nutrientes. Los valores de pérdida de suelo por erosión hídrica oscilan los 0.5-2 tn/ ha. año.A su vez la materia orgánica tiene un rol protagónico en las condiciones estructurales del suelo (además de promover la actividad biológica, generar estabilidad térmica y constituirse como sumidero de carbono y nutrientes), incrementando su capacidad de infiltración, por lo que su pérdida posibilita aún más al fenómeno de erosión (Viglizzo, s.f.). Se ha probado que el cambio en el contenido de materia orgánica bajo el actual sistema productivo tiene una magnitud significativa (Andriulo et. al, 1998), lo que repercute en los rendimientos y por lo tanto, en la actividad económica (Irurtia, 1995). Por otro lado, el stock de carbono del ecosistema se encuentra almacenado en la materia orgánica del suelo. La disminución de carbono edáfico implica un aumento del mismo en la atmósfera, contribuyendo al cambio climático (Görlach, 2004).  De hecho, los valores de reducción de materia orgánica alcanzan cerca del 2 % por San Carlos Sud. Considerando que muchos suelos de alta aptitud agrícola ronda el 3-4%, es un número elevado que puede generar pérdidas en la producción, el rendimiento y la sostenibilidad del sistema suelos.Por último, la disminución de la capacidad de infiltración mencionada afecta también a la capacidad de retención de agua, lo que incrementa la posibilidad de inundaciones.

Cabe aclarar que los árboles que no presentan buen estado de salud, decrepitud o corran un riesgo para las personas, son extraídos anualmente y se reponen si corresponde en el mismo espacio físico.

Por lo tanto, se espera que los cambios climáticos proyectados para Arteaga en el futurocercano incrementen la incidencia de estas afecciones. En este contexto, es fundamental asegurar quetoda la ciudad cuente con los servicios básicos de saneamiento (cloacas, agua potable, desagüespluviales) y se realicen campañas de prevención durante épocas de precipitaciones más frecuentes o dealtas temperaturas. Además, dado que la población de adultos y adultos mayores es en general la másafectada por las olas de calor, el incremento de la duración de las mismas requiere especial atención enel contexto del cambio climático. En el caso de Arteaga la población sensible a estos cambios llega al 30%, con un 16.7 % población de más de 65 años y el 13.8% menores de 12 años

Esteincremento de la temperatura podría generar un mayor consumo de energía, tanto en el sectorresidencial como público y comercial e industrial y, si no se cuenta con la infraestructura necesaria paraabastecer la demanda, podría verse interrumpido. De hecho, según la encuesta de Arteaga el 2% de loshabitantes no cuenta con agua potable y casi el 3% tiene casas tipo B, de infraestructura medianamentedeficiente, por lo que estas proyecciones podrían impactar directamente sobre estos sectores. Dadoque la población de adultos y adultos mayores es en general la más afectada por las olas de calor, elincremento de la duración de las mismas requiere especial atención en el contexto del cambio climático.

Puntualmente enArteaga se proyecta un incremento de dos días en la longitud de la mayor racha seca.Por otro lado, esta actividad en la temporada 2018/2019 ha tenido un 55% del suelo desnudo (ha habidoun solo cultivo en el año). Este factor, junto a la variabilidad de las lluvias y las lluvias extremas puedenagravar los procesos de erosión y degradación del suelo. La intensidad de precipitación, que según las proyecciones climáticas se incrementará en el futuro cercano, es el factor más importante de los quedeterminan la erosión del suelo por efecto de la lluvia. Un aumento de la intensidad de la lluviaproduciría un incremento en el tamaño, masa y velocidad de la gota, aumentando su velocidad ycontribuyendo al proceso de erosión con su consiguiente impacto sobre la materia orgánica y la emisiónde carbono. Por otro lado, en la etapa de sedimentación, por disminución de la energía del escurrimiento(ya sea por disminución de la pendiente o por obstáculos que reducen la velocidad) se produce eldepósito de las partículas del suelo. Este depósito puede destruir cultivos y dañar infraestructuras comocaminos, vías férreas, etc. (MinAGyP, 2011).Los daños causados por las variaciones en las precipitaciones, e intensificados por procesos productivosde monocultivo y de barbechos prolongados puede afectar a la perpetuidad del recurso suelo. Estasconsideraciones deben ser tenidas en cuenta sobre todo porque la mayoría de los arteaguenses (65%)no trabajan en el agro sino en empresas de menos de 5 trabajadores, por lo que el perjuicio de esterecurso, que se encuentra altamente concentrado (CNA, 2018) es para el beneficio económico de laminoría. Además, el 35% de los ciudadanos adjudica como fuentes de contaminación al agro y casi el100% exige medidas concretas por parte de la municipalidad. En este contexto el gobierno local harealizado una ordenanza de regulación de fitosanitarios que se desarrolla en este documento en elapartado correspondiente. Ante esto es necesario una transición agroecológica baja en insumossintéticos

Flooding can worsen due to siltation of waterways (natural and otherwise) or damaged or ineffective drainage. Floods have also been associated with deforestation in the Cagayan watershed, which is expected to increase baseflow, intensify siltation of the river, and reduce infiltration and water storage capacity of soils.  Floods can also be induced or worsened by release of water from the Magat Dam. Floods can further be aggravated by land subsidence which is the result of rapid groundwater extraction from wells over several years. a thorough scientific study on this aspect is yet to be undertaken.

En el año 2000 la superficie impermeabilizada por urbanización era de 544 ha, mientras que en el día de hoy son 925 ha, lo que supone un aumento del 70% en dos décadas. Según la UNESCO, 1987, una impermeabilización del 70% se puede traducir en una disminución del tiempo de escurrimiento del 88% y un aumento de los caudales máximos del 157%, por lo que repercute directamente sobre la intensidad de las inundaciones. Como la infraestructura correspondiente no ha podido llegar a todos los loteos, las edificaciones han ido aumentando, los espacios verdes y suelos absorbentes han disminuido, lo que se refleja en puntos críticos donde las calles sufren anegamientos. Sin embargo, el río no presenta desbordes desde el año 2016, fenómeno que ya no presenta una amenaza por la obra del empréstito provincial en el año 2018-2019. Por otro lado en el 2019 surgieron nuevas zonas de anegamientos que son las que se reflejan en la figura 21. Se categorizan con criticidad media, baja y alta. Los tres puntos de criticidad baja cuentan con antecedentes en donde los desagües no alcanzan a captar todo lo que recibe de la cuenca, fundamentalmente el de la zona centro. En el punto de criticidad media que se encuentra más al norte, existen entubados de uno de los ramales del arroyo que no gozan de la capacidad suficiente de captación, lo que genera anegamientos reiterados, sobre todo sobre calle Stronatti en su intersección con la vía. En las dos zonas de alta criticidad colapsan los sistemas de captación, aunque la del este ha mejorado gracias a la reciente obra de calle Presidente Perón donde se amplió la sección del canal existente, careciendo la zona de criticidad alta oeste de un entubamiento que la sanee.

Este sistema engloba las cuencas del Arroyo Las Conchas, y del Arroyo La Ensenada, las cuales, al sur y al norte respectivamente, incluyen a la ciudad de Crespo. En la década del 30 se sembraban aproximadamente 1 millón de hectáreas en la provincia. En esta época se generalizó el proceso de erosión hídrica en los suelos de Entre Ríos los cuales se labraban con arado de reja y vertedera, sumado a otras causas antrópicas como el desmonte, la labranza de pastizales naturales, el monocultivo de lino, la quema de rastrojos y el uso inadecuado del suelo sin tener en cuenta la aptitud de las tierras, entre otros (Engler et al., 2007). Además, los suelos son arcillosos, por lo que la infiltración es muy lenta, y los horizontes inferiores tienen alta dificultad para transmitir agua, por lo que, a grandes eventos de precipitaciones, la erosión hídrica puede ser muy alta. Esto produce una pérdida de suelos, que en el caso de la cuenca del Arroyo La Ensenada, ha alcanzado las 28 toneladas de suelo por año por hectárea, y un total en la cuenca que supera las dos millones de toneladas por año, situación que se ve mejorada con la utilización de terrazas de cultivo, llegando a 400.000 toneladas15 (INTA, 2018). Es importante tomar conciencia de que, en zonas con erosión potencial moderada y severa es imprescindible realizar medidas de control para detener procesos degradatorios irreversibles, en tanto que en sectores con grado leve también es recomendable la practica como medida de prevención (INTA, 2018).Estas graves amenazas son alertadas por la Secretaría de Ambiente y Desarrollo Sustentable de la Nación en el Inventario de Humedales del corredor fluvial Paraná-Paraguay, que explicita que con urgencia se debería comenzar a trabajar en la remediación de las áreas degradadas del sistema de humedales de los tributarios entrerrianos cortos del río Paraná.

It disrupts mobility by closing roads, degrades water quality and biodiversity by carrying debris, salt, and chemicals into Lake Michigan, the Skokie River, and the North Branch of the Chicago River, destabilizes the ravine structure and ecosystem, and causes property damage to homes and businesses.  As much as Highland Park works to improve stormwater management within City limits, it is downstream of large developments that increase the volume of stormwater heading its way independent of climate change.  This is a significant issue for properties adjacent to the rivers, and for all users of Lake Michigan water. The ravines are vulnerable not only to the higher volume of stormwater, but also by the velocity at which the stormwater flows during intense events. Despite heavier rains, the lower than historical average winter snowpack is causing drought-like failure of many vegetated areas, further compromising ravine stability.  The City predicts that ravine-adjacent homeowners will need to construct protection infrastructure over the coming decades.  Highland Park’s two rivers, the Skokie and North Branch, will be impacted by more frequent and intense storm events.  Greater areas of adjacent land will flood, increasing the strain on the City’s budget to acquire that land for mitigation projects. The risk of mobility impacts caused by climate change in Highland Park, primarily from increased stormwater volume, is expected to be high and the effect is already measurable.  Long term capital planning costs are expected to escalate, and changes to the municipal code may be required to influence the permeable areas per lot size, and/or increasing stormwater utility fees.  This issue impacts the entire population and all areas of the City.  We do not yet have an accounting of the financial impact directly applicable to flooding.

It is anticipated that climate change could make heavy snowfall more frequent, perhaps at least one 12-inch snowfall in a 24-hour period every year or every three years.  The City, its residents, and the business community are financially and socially prepared for the current frequency, but any increase will be noticeable.  The loss of instructional days for students, loss of business days for employers, and the increased demand for municipal services will have a direct impact on the City.  This issue impacts the entire population and all areas of the City.  We do not yet have an accounting of the financial impact directly applicable to snow.

It is reasonable to project an increase in hail events due to climate change.  Damage to facilities could increase, but any event that brings hail likely would also bring heavy winds, so it is the combination that would increase property damage rather than hail alone.  Our hazard assessment identified wind as a greater risk to the City than hail.

The City is heavily forested, so the primary impacts of high winds are loss of mobility due to tree debris in the road, and electrical service disruption due to downed power lines.  Our hazard assessment predicts an increase in the frequency and intensity of high wind events.  This will put a strain on City services which are responsible for clearing debris from roadways, and on quality of life and commercial activity during times of electrical power loss.  This issue impacts the entire population and all areas of the City.  We do not yet have an accounting of the financial impact directly applicable to wind.

While the lake does not experience storm surges as found in ocean-side communities, the seiche phenomenon, where high winds cause lake levels to increase on one side while decreasing on the other, can produce similar impacts.  The greatest risk in Highland Park is erosion of the beaches and bluffs along the shoreline.  Two recent incidents highlight the risks of shoreline erosion. In April 2018, a home on the shores of Lake Michigan just 35 miles north of Highland Park began to crumble into the lake due to erosion.  The Army Corps does not assist homeowners in this situation and private insurance does not cover the cost of damages; the homeowners are even responsible for the cost to remove the debris from the lake. In Highland Park there are over 75 residences along the shoreline.  In July 2018, a 60-foot section of a bluff in Lake Forest, just six miles north of the City, collapsed into the lake following a heavy rain event.  The rebuilding effort is expected to cost the City at least $1.5 million dollars.  In Highland Park, beach structure permit applications have increased since 2016, an indication that shoreline vulnerability is already increasing.

An increase in the frequency and intensity of lightening events would likely lead to a notable loss of tree canopy which is both a natural areas concern, and also a demand on City services to clear the streets of debris.  This impacts the entire City and we do not yet have an accounting of the financial cost associated with lightning and thunderstorms.

The most recent example is the 2019 Polar Vortex when schools closed for two days due to the extremely cold wind chill (50 degrees below zero), virtually all economic activity came to a  halt as well, and the cold spell in total lasted nearly a week.  This deep cold puts a severe strain on utility infrastructure, primarily water lines, which is most stressful for residents who may not be prepared to protect their service lines from freezing.  Our hazard assessment anticipates that extreme cold will negatively impact the City's budget and lead to degradation of natural areas.  More days of extreme cold often result in overtime for City staff and greater use of trucks and equipment.  Road closures will increase due to water main breaks and roadway buckling caused by the freeze-thaw cycle. The budget for road salt is based on high-use years of the past, but the extreme freeze-thaw cycle now becoming normal requires the same volume of salt even without snow.  The water main breaks and roadway buckling also lead to costly repairs.  The extreme freeze/thaw cycle is leading to increased applications of salt during the winter to combat more frequent ice build-up on roadways.  The snow melt runoff, contaminated with this higher level of salt, will eventually reach the rivers and lake where it may have negative impacts on the ecosystem.  This impacts the entire city and we do not yet have an accounting of the financial cost associated with extreme cold.

The region in which Highland Park is located has historically experienced heavy snowfall - at least 12 inches in 24 hours - every few years for at least 100 years.  The hazard assessment projects that this will continue but may fluctuate in multiple and unpredictable ways, such as when the snow occurs (January and February are normal, December and March are not), and in the number of major snow events per season; up to 24 inches in 48 hours has occurred in the past, but were this to happen more than once in a season or more than two seasons in a row, it would be considered extreme.  The impacts of heavy snowfall include disruption in education and commerce (school and business closures), increased demand for City services (snow plowing, debris removal, water line breaks), and strain on emergency services due to a combination of injuries (slip and fall, snow shovelling) and limited access to roadways. This impacts the entire city and we do not yet have an accounting of the financial cost associated with extreme winter conditions."

The City has no record of major health events specifically tied to climate impacts such has heat stress emergency calls. Our climate hazard assessment projects that a higher number of extreme heat days will strain emergency services as they respond to more health-related calls and will be compounded as the City’s population ages.   A heat wave in particular - at least three consecutive days of extreme heat - would strain the City's current capacity. The School of Public Health at the University of Illinois at Chicago sponsors a program that monitors the public health impacts of climate change.  In a 2017 study using nearly 30 years of Illinois-specific hospitalization data, researchers determined that Lake County (where Highland Park is located) has a rate of hospitalization for heat illness of 2.66.  This is the baseline figure, and future studies will show whether or not changes in this figure can be correlated to climate change.  It is important to note that current rate of heat illness is the same rate as Cook County, where the 1995 heat wave resulted in the deaths of over 700 individuals.  Health statistics are maintained by the Lake County Health Department, therefore the City will collaborate with the County to analyze future data.  This impacts the entire city and we do not yet have an accounting of the financial cost associated with heat waves.

The primary impact of extreme heat is on human health and the corresponding demand for City and emergency services.  However, our assessment also considers a warmer than usual winter (even with some days of extreme cold) to be directly connected to other negative impacts to natural areas and human health during times of extreme heat.  Warmer winters increase the population of rodents, pests, and insects, which then increase the incidents of vector-borne diseases during the rest of the year.  Additionally, warmer winters lead to lower snow levels, which is necessary for the health of this region's vegetation.  Highland Park is heavily vegetated and during times of extreme heat, plants and trees that received less winter moisture are more prone to death and fire.  This impacts the entire city and we do not yet have an accounting of the financial cost associated with extreme hot days."

The hazard assessment projects that river flooding events will increase in frequency and duration, and this affects many areas throughout the City.  The City's share of property buy-outs varies due to project cost, but the City tends to budget at least $500,000 every other year for this purpose.

It can be estimated that Essex County will experience between five and six events of heavy snowfall a year with moderate property damage.  There are no reported deaths or injuries from these events, however future deaths and injuries still remain a risk. All critical facilities in Beverly are considered vulnerable to the effects of severe winter storms due to the potential disruption of services and transportation systems as well as possible structure failure due to heavy snow loads.

This is threatening our ability to divert surface water for municipal use in the summertime, and will reduce the amount of water available for irrigation during the peak growing season. Currently approximately 50% of County residents rely primarily on surface water supplies, which are projected to decline by 25-33% by the 2050's.  Demand will increase as temperature increases.  Drought also impacts the local environment, resulting in deforestation. Reduction of water will increase tensions on water rights and sharing of water between urban and rural areas. Drought will also negatively impact local agriculture, and lack of snow will affect the ski tourism economy.

Many residents do not have air conditioning, and the COVID-19 pandemic made accessing cooler indoor environments (e.g. libraries, restaurants, community centers, senior centers etc.) not possible, forcing residents to stay in their homes. As extreme heat days become more common, residents with sub-par living conditions (e.g. poorly insulated or ventilated homes) will be more susceptible to heat exhaustion and heat stroke, especially the elderly.

That storm resulted in more than $150 million in damages and the loss of one life, and required more than 80 emergency rescues to prevent additional loss of life.  The modeling conducted by the UW-Madison climate scientists (WICCI)  confirms the predictions in the Fourth  National Climate Assessment which indicates that these extreme precipitation events will increase in frequency and the larger the precipitation event the larger the increase in relative frequency.   Therefore, we can expect more events with similar or increased damages and costs."

Históricamente  han  generado afectaciones  recurrentes y  han  ocasionado  la  pérdida  de  vidas. así  como  daños  a viviendas e infraestructura urbana, por lo tanto, son un capítulo importante dentro de los fenómenos  perturbadores identificados  para  el  municipio,  y  por  lo tanto  es  necesario hacer una evaluación de carácter puntual.Los deslizamientos son fenómenos en donde existe movimiento del suelo y el horizonte de rocas más superficiales cuesta abajo, se encuentra controlado por la gravedad. Por las condiciones geológico-geomorfológicas que registra el municipio se tienen documentados diversos tipos de deslizamiento de tierras.Dentro de este esquema de clasificación los movimientos, los que se han identificado para el municipio de Tonalá son: desprendimiento de rocas,  desprendimiento  de  tierras,  y mega deslizamientosDerrumbesLos alcances corresponden, con una clasificación del territorio a partir de la caracterización de  los afloramientos  rocosos, así como, los procesos en las unidades geomorfológicas y la presencia del tipo de cubierta vegetal y el trazo de caminos para poder identificar los cortes artificialesLa  periodicidad,  área  de ocurrencia y  grado  de  impacto  de  los  derrumbes  dentro  del municipio: Estos fenómenos suceden particularmente en la época de lluvias o durante sismos importantes, por lo que su ocurrencia es de carácter esporádico.

Particularmente, a la presencia de tres condiciones específicas del subsuelo:•	Hundimientos diferenciales asociados a rellenos.•	Hundimientos diferenciales asociados a presencia de arcillas autóctonas.La mayor parte de los hundimientos, están asociados a cuestiones de relleno, mala compactación de los taludes, fugas en el sistema de agua potable y drenaje y a las malas prácticas constructivas de las viviendas sobre pendientes empinadas.	Hundimientos asociados con rellenos de zona bajas, antiguos bancos de material y terraplenes de bordos, se  registran en la planicie  de  Santa Paula-  Agua  Blanca,  se  ha observado  que  existía  una  gran cantidad de bordos y presas las cuales  fueron plautinamente abandonadas, el proceso urbano  se monto sobre esta infraestructura , un ejemplo claro de esta situación es la urbanización que se dio en la delegación de San Miguel La PuntaEn los años 90s, era una zona baja pantanosa, la parte más deprimida, se utilizaba  para  extracción de  material  principalmente  de  arcilla  para  elaborar  ladrillo,  se urbanizo las zonas menos propicias, zonas bajas sobre aguas abajo de los bordos, se relleno parcialmente la parte baja y se relleno a manera de una rampa el frente del bordo, esto ha traído consecuencias, como fuertes hundimientos en zonas de relleno e inundaciones en las zonas bajas, generándose fuertes acumulaciones de agua en las zonas en donde se entrampa debido al trazo de la retícula Hundimientos deslizamiento asociados a terraplenes.Debido a la urbanización en las márgenes de las barrancas o en las laderas de los cerros,  zonas donde la pendiente es fuerte, se ha observado inestabilidad	de terraplenes,	los	cuales	están generando problemas de asentamiento  importantes  en  las  viviendas,  ejemplo  desarrollos como Urbi, en  Colimilla Periodicidad, área de ocurrencia y grado de impacto."

Increasing	Increasing	High	Immediately	Las inundaciones en función del crecimiento urbano han escalado tanto en superficie afectada, recurrencia, como en impacto, debido a las consecuencias de la urbanización acelerada que vino acompañada de una falta de planeación. Se determina que es un peligro climático con probabilidad alta y consecuencias moderadas.Las inundaciones actuales en el municipio de Zapopan son producto de una modificación en el clima manifestada más notoriamente a partir del año 2000 hasta la actualidad, en donde la tendencia ha sido la presencia de lluvias cada vez más extremas en periodos de tiempo cortos, así como ausencia de las mismas en épocas o meses donde antes si solían presentarse. Sin embargo, se observa que la acción humana y el inadecuado crecimiento urbano de Zapopan han sido parte crucial en la generación de nuevos puntos de inundación.

En cambio, en las áreas urbanas, se cuentan con afectaciones en energía eléctrica, en las redes de semaforización y caos viales generalizados. Por tanto, si se habla de la presencia de este fenómeno como peligro climático implica consecuencias moderadas con una probabilidad media (se da en un 35% entre junio y agosto según el Estudio de Riesgos de la ZMG de 1993), debido a que acompaña a las lluvias intensas llamadas localmente tormenta, chubasco, diluvio, cordonazo (Gobierno de Zapopan, 2012), las cuales  se presentan con nubes de tipo cumulonimbus (Gobierno de Zapopan, 2012).

Algunas de las principales causas son factores tanto externos como internos o intrínsecos. Los factores o causas externas que pueden producirlo son cambios sobre la superficie del terreno, como los cortes del terreno, cambios morfológicos del terreno por cortes no tecnificados y efectos climáticos. Las precipitaciones, cambios bruscos de temperatura o vientos huracanados también pueden incidir en los movimientos de masas. En el municipio se han encontrado peligros de hundimientos en varias colonias afectando casa habitación en zonas muy puntuales. Los  deslaves son menos frecuentes pero suceden en situaciones donde se deforesta y se comienza con la construcción de zona urbana  por la falta de arbolado en partes muy erosionadas y la mala planeación de la macha urbana.Aumenta la probabilidad del desprendimiento de tierras y de hundimientos por la mala planificación de la zona urbana en el municipio .

These occurrences may lead to a reduction of the forest potential, pest increase, an increase in invasive species and loss of biodiversity and  can affect even water quality and air quality.The recurrence of fires, ie, the number of years between each fire in a specific site, is likely to increase, exacerbating the 'fire> invasive> fire cycle' and the inherent forest management problems. Frequent fires alone may lead to a predominance of shrub vegetation. In this situation, the elimination of the native species seed bank will make it easier to  invasive species of subtropical origin to proliferate, such as some acacias already existing in the mountains as naturalized that benefict from the new climatic conditions.

Rates of coastal erosion and incidents of flooding are expected to increase throughout this century because of the increasing frequency and magnitude of storms and rising sea levels as a result of global warming. Evolution of the shoreline represents a threat to the sustainability of some coastal communities and these threats need to be managed through the planning process to ensure that development in areas subject to coastal erosion and flooding are sustainable and safe. Any mechanism to achieve this needs to ensure the continued sustainability of coastal communities in terms of access to facilities and services, location specific uses (such as those related to the sea) critical infrastructure for access, water and power and be clear regarding the appropriateness of certain types of development in areas likely to be affected by erosion. In addition, some nationally and internationally designated habitat and the provision of a continuous coastal path will be impacted through coastal erosion.

Toutefois celles-ci sont liées aux aléas climatiques, au relief, à la géologie et aux facteurs anthropiques (urbanisation, déforestation, etc.). En effet, la pauvreté grandissante, l’incivisme des populations ainsi que la faible capacité d’anticipation des autorités municipales poussent les populations à s’installer spontanément dans les zones non aménagées que constituent les bas-fonds marécageux et les flancs de montagnes obstruant ainsi l’écoulement des eaux et s’exposant aux inondations. De plus l’urbanisation augmente le ruissellement des eaux tout en diminuant l’infiltration et l’évapotranspiration. Ainsi, au fur et à mesure que la Commune s’urbanise, il devient difficile que les eaux de pluies s’infiltrent dans le sol, elles s’écoulent donc directement vers l’aval en faisant fluctuer rapidement le niveau des cours d’eaux et des rivières; et dans un contexte marqué par une urbanisation anarchique on assiste à des inondations spectaculaires. L’impact le plus grave qui résulte de ces inondations est le risque sanitaire. En effet, pendant les périodes d’inondation, les eaux débordent les latrines et les puits et il s’en suit un échange de pollution entre les effluents de latrines et les eaux de puits. Après l’inondation, le cours de la vie redevient normal et les populations s’alimentent de nouveau en eau dans les puits contaminés, s’exposant aux différentes maladies hydriques dont la plus redoutée est sans doute le choléra. En outre, ces inondations dégradent les rues, entrainent des pertes importantes.

En general, las áreas donde estos fenómenos ya han ocurrido en el pasado son altamente susceptibles a que los mismos se repitan.  Por lo que se hace de vital importancia contar con  fuentes de información  en el tema, mapas de zonificación de casos ocurridos de inestabilidad geológica, inventarios de riesgos geológicos, mapas de incidentes de años anteriores , contar con históricos de períodos de  retorno,  entre otros,  y de esta manera monitorear por sistemas de sistemas de alerta temprana en las áreas vulnerables a la amenaza de deslizamientos ya identificadas, educación a la población con el fin de aprender a convivir con el riesgo,  salvaguardar la vida humana y a su vez  definir la capacidad del uso de la tierra e identificar medidas apropiadas de mitigación.

La urbanización de zonas periféricas de la ciudad ha incrementado también los riesgos en zonas más céntricas, que tradicionalmente no se inundaban o lo hacían de forma menos intensa.La mayor superficie con zonas sujetas a peligros de inundación abarcan 693 ha, equivalentes a 5.5% del territorio de este municipio. A pesar de que podría interpretarse como una pequeña proporción de superficie afectada, lo cierto es que en todas las regiones de la ciudad hay áreas sujetas a inundación, en ocasiones condicionadas por las características del medio natural y su transformación por el desarrollo urbano, pero en otras el factor desencadenante es la ausencia de infraestructura que facilite la salida del agua de lluvia o por el escaso mantenimiento de ésta (limpieza de traga-tormentas).

Estas alterações poderão ainda potenciar o aparecimento e desenvolvimento de outras vulnerabilidades e riscos, nas áreas e sectores já afetados atualmente ou em novas áreas e sectores. A evolução e interação entre os fatores climáticos e não-climáticos (sociais, demográficos, ocupação do território, planeamento, entre outros) revestem-se de particular importância uma vez que podem alterar as condições de exposição e sensibilidade a eventos climáticos futuros.As alterações mais significativas projetadas para os parâmetros climáticos no concelho de Lagos estão relacionadas com o aumento das temperaturas do ar máxima e mínima, com o aumento significativo do número de dias de verão e de dias com noites tropicais e com um aumento moderado do número de dias muito quentes e do número de dias em onda de calor.

The disturbance of natural landcover and the increase of impervious surfaces has contributed to faster stormwater runoff, which in turn has increased the likelihood of rivers and tributaries to flood. Previous floods have impacted commercial and residential properties, particularly those of lower-income families who are more commonly located in or near floodplains. Impacts have also been felt along roadways limiting access to emergency responders.

While this area does not face the more severe impacts seen on the coast, these events have produced light to severe damage to property and endangered human health.As this assessment was in its final stages of preparation, Hurricane Florence struck the Carolinas. Initial projections showed Florence’s track would lead it directly through the Triangle Region. To prepare for the storm, our jurisdictions coordinated with one another, the State government, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, local organizations, businesses and our residents to support and protect our communities.Though the Triangle Region was spared the worst impacts of the disaster, significant rain and wind caused flooding, road closures, and power outages. The Triangle Region was also host to evacuees from coastal North Carolina during the storm and in its immediate aftermath.

Periods of drought are linked to increased risk of wildfire as well as increased dust particulates in the air which can exacerbate chronic respiratory conditions such as asthma. With more than 120 farms and 9000 acres of irrigated farmland, Orange County's agricultural industry is also susceptible to drought, particularly when it is sustained over a long period.

Increasing temperatures contribute to increased fire frequency, intensity, and size. Additionally, wildfire smoke contains particulate matter, carbon monoxide, and other harmful emissions that significantly reduce air quality both locally and in areas downwind of fires. Smoke from wildfires hundreds of miles away can affect people’s health.Despite the urban nature of the Triangle, the map shows that it is still in the second highest quantile for forested regions in the nation (51 to 75 percent), making it an area of concern for exposure to wildfire. Most residents in the Triangle region value having these forested areas in their neighborhoods. While this adds to quality of life, it does raise the danger of available fuels that might lead to wildfire. 96.0% of residential properties in the assessment are exposed to wildfire risks, although only 6.7% have a Medium to High combined score for Vulnerability and Risk. 81.3% of commercial properties in the assessment are exposed to wildfire risks, although only 1.1% have a Medium to High combined score for Vulnerability and Risk.

The West Midlands had an estimated 90-130 excess deaths during this period.   Being a largely urban area, heat waves are amplified by the urban heat island (UHI) effect which in 2003 pushed average temperatures 3°C higher than the neighbouring rural areas.   It is suggested that the UHI contributed up to 52%  of heat related mortality.  During the 2003 heatwave, ambulance call outs in Birmingham increased by a third.  Globally, average temperatures are 1°C higher than in 1850, and if we continue to emit greenhouse gases at today's rate, that could be 5°C by the end of the century.  Research using median estimates for increased temperatures, in conjunction with the effect of the UHI, and population projections, predict heat related mortality will  rise by 53% in the 2020s and 209% in the 2080s compared with the 2003 heatwave.  In the West Midlands, Met Office heatwave warnings were issued as recently as summer 2020, with local NHS trusts providing guidance to help people deal with the conditions.

As of 2017, the number of people in the West Midlands deemed to be living in an area of high surface flood risk, was 12,495.   In addition, 25 services, (schools, hospitals, etc, ),  1,101 non-residential properties,  38km of roads, and 18km of railway and 126 hectares of grade 1,2,and 3 agricultural land were also deemed to be at a high risk, demonstrating that flooding is a perennial threat.  In future, it is plausible that extreme storm events could increase by as much as 40%, with winter precipitation predicted to increase by around 12%.  This would also see a threefold increase in the likelihood of 'very wet days' (defined as more than 25mm in a 24 hour period).  These are based on UK climate projections.  This is likely to push many of those living under a current 'moderate risk' into a higher risk category,

In 2020, we have already seen disruption to the transport network and some localised property damage from storms Ciara and Dennis.  In future, with greater extremes in prospect, it is likely that incidences of severe winds will increase in magnitude.   This poses challenges to the transport sector, and to those in sub-standard housing.   It can also pose a threat to the energy and telecommunication network.  This can have negative consequences for emergency response and public health outcomes.  It is worth noting that periods of high wind often occur alongside periods on heavy rain and therefore further compound identified risks.

This includes the following: Ciampea Village in Ciampea District, Cijayanti Village in Babakan Madang District, Bantarjaya Village in Rancabungur District, Cintamanik Village in Cigudeg Subdistrict, Tapos Village in Tenjo District. These areas have been experiencing more dry months than wet months annually in the last 30 years. Based on the reports by the Regional Disaster Management Agency (BPBD), the following areas have begun to experience water shortages during the dry season: Jonggol, Ciampea, Cibadak, Sukamakmur, and East Bogor. This has driven some communities in Cijayanti Village to desperately invate a water tank truck belonging to the BPBD. Community members also queue for clean water rations distributed by the Bogor Regency Government during dry seasons. Residents are also forced to use water from the river to meet their daily needs due to unavailability of water from dry  wells. For those  who can afford it, on the other hand, they buy water from refilling stations to meet their daily water supply from drinking and cooking. It is hoped that in the short or soon period of time, the frequency of the impact of the drought hazard  in the vulnerable areas will decrease by improving the disaster response management system.

Some villages in Bogor Regency that have high landslide risk include Palasari Village in Cijeruk District, Pasir Jaya Village in Cigombong District, Kuta Village in Megamendung District, Cijayanti Village and Karang Tengah Village in Babakan Madang District and other villages. This is because the  area has a slope above 15% and is included in the land movement vulnerability zone which has the potential for landslides.Landslides that were recorded occurred from 2002-2017, the highest incidence of landslides occurred in 2017 as many as 39 events, the most casualties occurred in 2014 as many as 24 people died / disappeared. As a result of the disaster, it caused many casualties and damage to both houses and other public facilities and infrastructure.It is hoped that in the short or soon period of time, the frequency of the impact of the landslide hazard  in the vulnerable areas will decrease by improving the disaster response management system.

Gunung Putri sub-district appears to have the highest number of people exposed to disasters, reaching 450,000 in the high-risk class.In addition, Bojong Gede, Cibinong, Cileungsi and Gunung Putri Subdistricts also have the potential for substantial losses to extreme weather disasters (whirlwinds), which is more than 300 billion Rupiah. Cibinong Subdistrict appears to have the highest losses compared to other sub-districts in Bogor Regency, reaching 557 billion Rupiah. This is because the sub-district is the center of activity and the region with the fastest economic growth, especially the losses to public facilities and critical facilities in the sub-district in the event of this disaster.Based on the matrix for determining the level of threat of extreme weather disasters in Bogor Regency, the high threat level with a high / medium hazard index and a high / medium exposed population index indicates that almost all areas of Bogor Regency have a high level of extreme weather threat, especially in the North and Central parts of the Regency. Bogor. Several villages that have a high level of extreme weather threat include Sukaharja Village in Cijeruk District, Sukmajaya Village in Tajur Halang District, Cipinang Village in Rumpin District, Pondok Rajeg Village in Cibinong District and Cinangneng Village in Tenjolaya District. The extreme weather hazard map shows that areas that have a high level of extreme weather threat, in this case whirlwinds, are areas with high land openness with sloping and wide topographical conditions.It is hoped that in the short or soon period of time, the frequency of the impact of the Tornado  hazard  in the vulnerable areas will decrease by improving the disaster response management system.

Heavy rainfall is also leading to flooding and overflow of the canals. This eventually affects the drainage in the city. All these issues are affecting the  regular functioning of urban systems and human life. The impacts are expected to increase over years, since climate is tremendously varying.

Las tormentas severas constituyen la principal amenaza para la ciudad de Corrientes. Esta amenaza, en conjunción con una situación de vulnerabilidad social en determinadas zonas de la ciudad y factores de origen humano, como la mala disposición de residuos y la carencia de suelo permeable, tornan a la amenaza de gran peligrosidad y riesgo para la población afectada.La consecuencia directa generada es la obstrucción de red de desagües fluviales. En efecto y debido a ésta problemática, el municipio se ve obligado a realizar obras de limpieza y mantenimiento de los canales, sean estos a cielo abierto, bocas de tormenta o ductos.Por otro lado, la escasa accesibilidad de los barrios periféricos a espacios verdes y amigables de calidad, en conjunto con la escasez de árboles en la ciudad, constituyen un problema que, si lo analizamos juntamente con el de basurales, podemos proponer una posible solución de esa misma manera: Corrientes tiene hoy un promedio de 2,52 m² de espacios verdes por habitante conforme Master Plan de Planeamiento Urbano. Además, es necesario tomar en cuenta que 83 barrios no cuentan con tales espacios. Según la Organización Mundial de la Salud, una ciudad debe tener entre 10 y 15 m² como mínimo por habitante. La escasez en parte es generado por el desarrollo indiscriminado de la infraestructura en detrimento de la cantidad de espacios verdes y suelos permeables; agravan el problema, afectando al buen drenaje de las aguas

Vale mencionar la existencia de un camino arbolado al norte de la localidad, aunque actualmente se encuentra abandonado y requiere de un mantenimiento. No existen otras barreras forestales desarrolladas en torno a las parcelas productivas que oficien de protección a las áreas residenciales, por lo que  la localidad se encuentra expuesta a este fenómeno (ECOM, 2019).  A pesar de que su frecuencia es baja, y de que, hasta el momento, no ha generado pérdidas económicas trascendentes, en el año 2003 hubo un tornado de gran magnitud que afectó a toda la región con voladura de techos, caída de árboles, cortes de cables, afección en galpones y automóviles. La comuna debió afrontar los costos correspondiente a reposición de árboles y luminarias de alumbrado públicas, y a la limpieza del pueblo con caída de ramas y postes.

Si bien no suelen ser frecuentes, cuando suceden, perjudican al sector productivo. Este fenómeno ya ha ocurrido en el municipio, y ha ocasionado pérdidas muy grandes en cosechas y se han ha declarado emergencia agropecuaria en consecuencia.

Por otro lado, se reconoce una tendencia al completamiento de la planta urbana histórica, especialmente en su sector de borde con características de uso residencial permanente, impulsado por la migración de otras localidades, fenómeno que se aceleró por el  PROCREAR. Esto ha implicado un aumento de la impermeabilización de los suelos, aspecto que aumenta aún más las posibilidades de anegamiento.  Sumado a esto, las proyecciones climáticas indican aumento en las precipitaciones para el futuro, por lo que estos fenómenos podrían agravarse.  Las inundaciones suelen darse al menos una vez al año, siendo los sectores más bajos (zona Sur y ambos márgenes del Arroyo Frías) los más afectados por las mismas. Por lo general, el acceso al pueblo también es propenso a inundarse ya que es donde desagua el agua de la zona rural. Se considera que unas 30 familias viven o tienen viviendas en las zonas de riesgo, siendo un total de 100 personas aproximadamente.

El modelo de producción predominante condiciona la salud edáfica, sobre todo intensificando dos procesos interrelacionados: la pérdida de materia orgánica y la erosión hídrica. Por un lado, en el transporte de sedimentos producido en el proceso de erosión se produce la pérdida de las partículas, entre ellas gran parte de la materia orgánica y los nutrientes. A su vez la materia orgánica tiene un rol protagónico en las condiciones estructurales del suelo (además de promover la actividad biológica, generar estabilidad térmica y constituirse como sumidero de carbono y nutrientes), incrementando su capacidad de infiltración, por lo que su pérdida posibilita aún más al fenómeno de erosión (Viglizzo, s.f.). Se ha probado que el cambio en el contenido de materia orgánica bajo el actual sistema productivo tiene una magnitud significativa (Andriulo et. al, 1998), lo que repercute en los rendimientos y por lo tanto, en la actividad económica (Irurtia, 1995). Por otro lado, el stock de Carbono del ecosistema se encuentra almacenado en la materia orgánica del suelo. La disminución de carbono edáfico implica un aumento del mismo en la atmósfera, contribuyendo al cambio climático (Görlach, 2004).  Asimismo, la disminución de la capacidad de infiltración mencionada afecta también a la capacidad de retención de agua, lo que incrementa la posibilidad de inundaciones.

El sistema natural conserva parte de su dinámica original. Los ríos Negro y Tragadero, en ciclos húmedos desbordan por avance del Paraná y el sistema de lagunas eleva su nivel por saturación de napas subterráneas. Si esto coincide con precipitaciones intensas, áreas completas se inundan. El valle, es un “lecho móvil” que periódicamente se inunda, y durante épocas de “bajante” da lugar al asentamiento humano, que luego es afectado por crecientes. El avance sin cuidado de la urbanización (formal e informal) y el progresivo relleno de reservorios conlleva una disminución en la superficie de infiltración y en la capacidad de absorción, y un aceleramiento del escurrimiento superficial.Si bien el Área Metropolitana del Gran Resistencia se encuentra protegida por un sistema de defensas, la ausencia de control en la ocupación de este ambiente permitió el asentamiento de población dentro de los límites de las líneas de ribera de los ríos y lagunas, así como la apropiación privada de estos recursos, llevó a que diferentes áreas de la ciudad estén expuestas a riesgos por la crecida periódica de los ríos y por las lluvias intensas. La falibilidad de todo este sistema y la falta de medidas estructurales de defensa y no estructurales de drenaje urbano y de la ocupación de áreas públicas demandan una adecuada y permanente gestión del riesgo ambiental y de concientización en la ocupación sostenible del territorio.La situación se hace más compleja tomando en cuenta los cambios proyectados según los modelos climáticos para el futuro cercano (2015-2039) considerando un escenario de emisiones altas (RCP 8.5). En este caso, se espera un incremento poco relevante de la precipitación media anual (0-10 ml por año). Sin embargo, como resultado del cambio climático, las proyecciones indican una tendencia en Resistencia hacia mayores valores de la precipitación anual acumulada en eventos de precipitación intensa, que implica un incremento en la torrencialidad de las precipitaciones y un aumento en la frecuencia e impacto de los desbordes de los ríos y lagunas que conforman el sistema lacustre de la ciudad.

It is expected that the five coastal barangays are likely to experience a permanent inundation of low-lying coastal areas by 2036 to 2065 and may affect a total of 30,321 population by 2030. Also, due to coastal flooding it is expected to have a higher demand for safe water supply. This will also result to the decrease in agricultural-fisheries production which will increase the migration rate of the people due to lack of livelihood in the area. Moreover, coastal flooding will increase the severity of health problems such as communicable diseases, respiratory ailments, exhaustion and cramps are expected to escalate specifically for the dependent population and people who are more exposed outside.

This river system serves as primary channels of runoff water from upland areas and from the city. Commonly, outfall areas within the city are drained into the Davao gulf, which also serves as the major outfall area of surrounding municipalities and cities. The presence of these two (2) rivers compounds the effects of rainfall and increasing human intervention in the upstream catchments making barangays Pagsabangan, Bincungan, Liboganon, Canocotan, Cuambogan, San Miguel, Apokon, Madaum, Magugpo East, Magugpo North, Magugpo South and Pandapan very highly susceptible to flooding affecting a total of 31,424 (27.01%) exposed population. Roads and bridges along flood plain areas in Tagum City were categorized as high risk and are exposed to high susceptible to flooding with an estimated flood height of greater than one meter. Disruption of access system in the identified flood plain areas which last for 2 days affecting settlements and production. Moreover, rice production and cavendish banana production areas in Pagsabangan and cavendish banana production areas in Cuambogan and Mankilam are highly at risk to flooding while coconut production areas in some parts of these barangays are also exposed to flooding. On the other hand, aquaculture production in coastal barangays is also highly affected by flooding. In 2017, flooding affected 12,781 hectares of production area (rice, coconut and garungan) amounting to Php 5,194,552.00 worth of production output. Consequently, 10,278 farming households’ livelihood and settlement are at risk. Residential areas are mostly exposed to flooding covering almost 700 ha from Brgys. Magugpo East, Apokon, Madaum, Mankilam, and Magdum with an exposed amount of Php 2.3 million (CDRA, 2017).   It is expected that  the future frequency and intensity of the hazard will be increased. This will result to the decrease in agricultural-fisheries production, increase the migration rate of the people due to lack of livelihood in the area and higher demand for safe water supply. Moreover, flash/surface flooding will increase the severity of health problems such as communicable diseases, respiratory ailments, exhaustion and cramps are expected to escalate specifically for the dependent population.

Landslide occurrences in this barangays are caused by heavy rains which affects a total of 7,876 exposed population from moderate to high landslide based on the Climate Change  Vulnerability and Risk Assessment (CCVRA). Rain-induced landslides have affected a considerable section of the city’s population, as well as urban areas, production and facilities. Institutional facilities of New Balamban and Pandapan, and the elementary school of Nueva Fuerza are moderately susceptible to landslide.  It is expected to worsen in the future while other hazards identified will intensify based on the data projected by PAGASA by 2036-2065. With the rapid urban infrastructure development in the city, economic activities and settlement areas are moving towards rural and upland areas that are very susceptible to landslide during heavy rains. These 6 barangays with an estimated population of 39,651 by 2030, increased number of business establishments and agriculture production areas that will be at risk by 2036-2065.

A total of 247 households and 880 individuals were affected. Also, the storm surges flooded the areas with saline water, resulting in salinity of agriculture areas, fishery and protected forest lands.It is anticipated that in the future, with the increasing occurrence of storms and typhoons in the city a total of 30,321 projected population will be at risk by 2030 and 100% of the existing natural coral reefs area of the city will be affected.

One of the most noticeable land use change over the years is the modification of the said Barangays into a commercial and residential area as the city’s Central Business District. In order to accommodate the developments, houses and buildings were concentrated in this area. Aside from these structures, tricycles and motorbikes amassed in the city center due to the volume of passengers. The change of its land use cover, presence of the built – up area and its lacking of available green open space affect the surface temperature and wind movement causing a warmer atmosphere of 1 - 3°C compared to the rural areas. Aside from its elevated temperature, the urban surface which is relatively made of concrete and asphalt, contributes to the Extreme Hot Days effect in the city. Compared to other well-known parks in the city, open space such as Freedom Park and Rotary Park are no longer shaded with trees and grass pavements. During extreme hot days, health conditions, air, and water quality are affected not just within the said brgys., but its neighboring barangays affecting the socio-economic perception and activities of its residents. On the other hand, some fishponds in the coastal barangays are experiencing abnormalities in fish sizes.  The warmer temperature and air quality in the area are expected to intensify. Thus, heat-related stress and rapid spread of contagious disease such as sore eyes and measles  especially to the young and old population will be escalated. Also, there will be a higher demand of electricity for cooling requirements with an average increase of 23% (GHG Inventory, 2018), hence higher greenhouse gas emissions. Increase in temperature in the coastal area may also result to heat stress causing coral bleaching restricting coral growth. Coral reefs are critical habitat for marine species. Warmer sea surface temperature disrupts the ecosystem resulting to heat stress coral bleaching and critical habitat for marine lives. It can also enhance the water acidity affecting the health of the marine species and increase in mortality. Fish migration is also possible once its natural habitat is disturbed and damaged heading towards cooler temperature.

Debido a ello, las laderas presentan fuertes pendientes y rasgos dominantes de erosión glacial (flancos truncados, circos, horns) y morrenas laterales y terminales, como resultado de la acción sedimentaria de los hielos. En las porciones superiores de las laderas es común encontrar importantes asomos rocosos, con formaciones en distintos grados de meteorización, los cuales son propensos a sufrir fragmentación y volcamiento hacia las laderas inferiores como consecuencia de las condiciones climáticas (lluvias y heladas, calentamiento y enfriamiento). A su vez, San Martin de los Andes se encuentra en un área con moderado riesgo sísmico. Los movimientos sísmicos también pueden ser causa de la caída de rocas y remociones en masa localizadas de las laderas. Sin embargo, no se han registrado eventos catastróficos (fuertes terremotos o importantes lluvias de cenizas) a lo largo de la historia de la ciudad.Por otro lado, San Martin de los Andes se encuentra en un área con una importante red de drenaje, que atraviesa toda el área urbana y sub-urbana, con diversos mallines que actúan como reguladores hídricos de la cuenca.Tal como se mencionó previamente, todo el ejido urbano se desarrolla en geoformas que favorecen los procesos geomorfológicos principalmente gravitacionales a causa de la dominancia de fuertes pendientes. Esta amenaza se presenta sobre aproximadamente 50% del ejido urbano. Además, los anegamientos y/o inundaciones en las proximidades de los arroyos y en los suelos relacionados con los mallines impactan sobre, aproximadamente el 12% del ejido urbano. A partir de estas observaciones, se elaboró un mapa del grado de peligrosidad al que se encuentra expuesta la población . Se observa que, el 53% del ejido urbano presenta una peligrosidad baja y media, y un 48% presenta peligrosidad alta y muy alta. Esto implica importantes complejidades de manejo y de planeamiento físico y urbanístico.

La sequía en este Municipio se clasifica como muy fuerte y repetitivo en los últimos nueve años, la zona de mayor afectación es en el centro del Municipio.La distribución y dotación de agua en la ciudad de Celaya se está convirtiendo en un grave problema, al grado de racionarla en algunas colonias durante la época de estiaje. Además, la expansión industrial del Corredor Celaya-Cortazar ha incrementado la demanda del recurso.El clima predominante en la ciudad es semiseco-semicálido siendo los meses de febrero a mayo los más secos y calurosos con temperaturas promedio de 27°C y un récord de 37° en 2018. Durante estos meses se presentan largas temporadas de sequía y escasez de agua, la practica de la agricultura no es posible y las actividades ganaderas se ven muy reducidas, ocasionando la escasez de trabajo y alimentos, en consecuencia hay aumento en los costos de la comida. Las personas de escasos recursos y grupos marginados son los mas afectados al no tener acceso a los servicios básicos de alimentación y centros de salud. La deshidratación y enfermedades son notables en esta temporada.•	El sector agropecuario sería el que más resentiría los efectos de esta amenaza, puesto que esto conlleva a un desabasto de agua tanto a la población como a la industria y principalmente en la producción agrícola y ganadera, además de provocar que el índice de erosión empiece a tener niveles de ligero a medio. La salud de la población sería seriamente amenazada por enfermedades de deshidratación e higiene aunado a la contaminación del aire.•	El sector hídrico seguramente al igual que el agropecuario sería de los más impactados, ya que el agua es uno de los elementos indispensables para la vida, así como para la mayoría de las actividades cotidianas que desarrollamos en el lugar donde pernoctamos.•	La contaminación del ambiente crece significativamente así como las condiciones del clima, ya que estas tienden a tener valores extremos. Una de las prioridades es la recarga adecuada del manto freático, ya que el acuífero de Celaya es uno de los más grandes del estado de Guanajuato."

Peru is not exempt from presenting alterations in average temperatures. The first months of 2017 saw the most extended heatwave in the last 19 years. The northern coast of the country had temperatures of 39.6°C in Chulucanas. In Lima and districts such as Jesús María, daytime temperatures of 30°C or more were recorded in 2017, when February is the hottest month in terms of weather, with occasional highs of 30°C. The heat causes the basal temperature to increase, generating a thermoregulatory center reaction that causes a massive flow of blood to the periphery and sweat. As a consequence, the cardiovascular system is overloaded and generates dehydration due to excessive fluid and electrolyte loss. Heatwaves increase the risk of mortality in vulnerable populations such as the elderly, babies, children, and people with disabilities and obesity.

The increase in global temperature causes the progressive melting of some glaciers in the tropical Andean region, commonly known as the tropical Andean glaciers. This situation causes short and long-term risks for Peruvian cities. Flooding is more frequent than before, and the main freshwater basins of coastal cities are losing their capacity to respond to demand. The Rimac River and, in general, the entire basin that meets the demand of Lima has a stationary flow. They depend on rainfall variations in the Andes and do not have a homogeneous regime throughout the year. The average annual flow of the Rimac River has a low flow during the dry season (May-November) and high flow during the rainy season during the rest of the year (December-April). This shows that the melting of the tropical Andean glaciers resulting from the climatic variables for the water supply on which Lima depends decreases the discharge of the Rimac basin, which directly affects the population.The vulnerability of the water supply of the Rimac basin and, therefore, of all its slopes as in the case of Huatica, when evaluated using the concepts of water scarcity and stress established by the United Nations, reveals an alarming panorama. When the annual water supply falls below 1,000 m3 per person, the population faces water scarcity, and below 500 m3 is absolute scarcity. The average annual per capita availability in the Rimac basin is eight times lower than the chronic water scarcity index. The increase in water demand in Lima and specifically in Jesús María over the next 20 years, together with the expected population growth and the reduction in water availability due to the melting of Andean glaciers, puts the municipality at high risk towards a scenario of water scarcity. On the other hand, in the last 37 years, ten episodes of severe droughts have been identified in Peru, reveals the study of ""Characterization of space and time of the drought in the Andean departments of Peru (1981-2018)"", being Lima one of the main cities affected. The effects of the drought are manifested by reducing the area planted concerning the total available agricultural area, putting the population's food security at serious risk."

Las tormentas de alta intensidad, traen aparejado la caída de árboles dentro del ejido urbano. Esta consecuencia se da por la implementación histórica del arbolado público sin una correcta planificación donde encontramos especies no recomendadas ni adaptadas para dicho fin. En el arbolado público de la ciudad predomina la especie Fraxinus americana. Esta especie puede crecer por encima de la media debido a las condiciones pluviométricas y no logran afianzarse sobre la estructura del suelo existente, por lo tanto ante fuertes vientos tienden a caerse, convirtiéndose en un riesgo para las infraestructuras de la ciudad y para los habitantes.

El Pasillo de los Tornados ocupa un amplio sector de América Latina: su núcleo central se ubica en Argentina (norte de la provincia de Buenos Aires, centro y este de Córdoba, sur y centro de Santa Fe y oeste de Provincia de Entre Ríos), Sur de Paraguay y toda la República Oriental del Uruguay. Dentro de esta zona existe mayor probabilidad de que se formen tornados, especialmente durante la temporada de primavera y verano.  El tornado se podrá vincular con el informe síntesis del IPCC sobre Cambio Climático (2014), ya que en el mismo documento se hace referencia a las diversas modificaciones en la atmósfera (temperatura, presión, humedad), a causa de las actividades antrópicas, que pueden favorecer a fenómenos extremos. Los impactos de estos fenómenos extremos relacionados con el clima incluyen la alteración de los ecosistemas, de la producción de alimentos, de abastecimiento de agua, daños en infraestructura y asentamientos, la morbilidad y mortalidad humana y consecuencias para la salud mental y el bienestar. Independientemente del nivel de desarrollo de un país, esos impactos coinciden con una falta considerable de preparación para la variabilidad climática actual en algunos sectores. Si bien, la ocurrencia de estos fenómenos extremos es asilada, la Ciudad de San Justo mediante su Plan de Adaptación al Cambio Climático estará preparada para enfrentar y sobreponerse ante este tipo de fenómenos.

No sólo la salud de la población sufrirá dichas consecuencias, sino también el servicio de agua potable (donde se espera un mayor consumo) y diversas infraestructuras propias de los centros poblados como son el asfalto y los sistemas de distribución de energía eléctrica. En cuanto a los factores biológicos, el aumento de temperatura traerá migraciones de especies y el posible aumento de enfermedades trasmitidas por vectores.

Se cría en recipientes (botellas, floreros, tachos, baldes, palanganas, bebederos de animales, tanques de agua, portamacetas) que contienen agua clara y quieta, presentes tanto en el interior de las casas como en patios, jardines, balcones.Dada esta afección, el Área de Salud del Municipio en asociación a la ONG Mundo Sano realiza durante todo el año un diganóstico preventivo colocando ovitrampas georreferenciadas en distintas partes de la ciudad y tomando un registro semanal de la presencia y cantidad de huevos de Aedes Aegypti lo que permite desarrollar acciones puntuales en los lugares más afectados. No obstante, la permanente concientización a la población que se intensifica en periodos estivales, se realiza durante todo el año un trabajo de descacharrado y limpieza de patios y lugares de aguas estancadas.Cuando se registran casos positivos de la enfermedad, junto al Ministerio de Salud de la Provincia se realizan bloqueos de las manzanas aledañas con fumigaciones específicas.

Esto demanda también presencia del servicio de emergencias médicas por riesgo de deshidratación. Al mismo tiempo, resulta necesario desde el Municipio intensificar el servicio de riego de calles de calzada natural a los efectos de disminuir la temperatura ambiental y evitar la dispersión de material particulado ocasionado por el tránsito vehicular.

Se espera una disminución poco relevante de la precipitación media anual (0-10 mm por año). Sin embargo, se espera un incremento considerable de la precipitación diaria máxima de entre 6 y 8 mm.Además, como resultado del cambio climático las proyecciones indican una tendencia en Avellaneda hacia mayores valores de la precipitación anual acumulada en eventos de precipitación intensa con valores de entre 25 y 50 mm. Es decir, un incremento en la torrencialidad de las lluvias.

En ella se extienden gran número de canales, cañadas y sectores deprimidos. Debido a esta particularidad del territorio, una de las principales amenazas registradas en Avellaneda es la inundabilidad.Ya sea por el desborde del Arroyo El Rey, que ha cortado la comunicación con la ciudad lindera de Reconquista en más de una ocasión, como por la saturación de los suelos, las inundaciones han generado graves consecuencias.Tanto en las áreas urbanizadas como los campos han sufrido este fenómeno, y dado que las proyecciones climáticas indican un aumento en la torrencialidad de las lluvias, esto podría agravarse.El registro da cuenta de que en los eventos extremos de precipitaciones los pozos ciegos se llenan con rapidez dejando salir al exterior su contenido. Por otra parte, debido a conexiones clandestinas de desagües pluviales a la red colectora cloacal, la misma también suele colapsar en momentos de grandes precipitaciones.El registro histórico tiene una reincidencia de inundaciones muy grande, siendo los últimos eventos más importantes los de abril de 1998, marzo de 2001, diciembre de 2014, diciembre de 2019 y abril de 2019.

Estos presentan gran susceptibilidad a incendios ya que se da acumulación de material senescente, junto a las características de alta capacidad incendiaria del pajonal. Esto se ve agravado por condiciones climáticas subtropicales de temperatura media mayor a 25°C en época estival y frecuente viento de velocidad leve-moderada. Sin embargo el mayor factor de riesgo para los incendios es el fuego provocado por la actividad antrópica con objetivos productivos, descuidos y falta de concientización de la sociedad sobre el patrimonio natural protegido. Otro sector afectado, importante en extensión, es el de sabanas de pastizales y palmares, bosques leñosos y selvas, de alto valor de conservación por la ley provincial de bosque nativo. Estas áreas presentan alto riesgo por incendios ya que su ubicación suele ser cercana a emplazamientos donde se utiliza el fuego de forma inducida, como casas de fin de semana y a viviendas de peones ganaderos. También las banquinas de rutas y caminos rurales son punto de contacto importante entre las personas y el medio natural, donde se inician parte de los incendios que luego afectan sistemas naturales. En época estival es frecuente que se den, de manera intencional o no, incendios de pastizales en banquinas y campos aledaños a la Ruta Nacional N°11 y a la Ruta Provincial N°31; esto genera inconvenientes en la normal circulación vehicular ya que disminuye mucho la visibilidad en la zona. Si bien el fuego es un factor propio de los sistemas naturales, su ocurrencia antrópica no controlada y el inicio de incendios genera múltiples aspectos negativos, como la liberación de grandes cantidades humo y dióxido de carbono al ambiente, pérdida de vida animal y vegetal, erosión de suelos, daño de infraestructuras productivas y comunitarias entre otras. Actualmente los planes de manejo de pastizales y ganadería que promueve el Comité Intersectorial de Manejo del Sitio Ramsar Jaukanigaas, promueven técnicas de corte del pajonal, dejando como última alternativa el uso de fuego como método de manejo, y en dicho caso su realización bajo condiciones de control del mismo

Si bien no hubo daños ni heridos, al aumentar la intensidad de las tormentas en el futuro cercano producto del cambio climático esto podría influir directamente en las zonas tanto rurales como urbanas de Avellaneda.Resultan con mayor frecuencia las tormentas fuertes y grandes cantidades de precipitación en poco tiempo, principalmente en el período estival, ocasionando anegamientos transitorios en algunos sectores de la ciudad donde a su vez suelen obstruirse los desagües por caída de ramas o efectos de la propia tormenta.

Estas actividades productivas produjeron una progresiva degradación, con menores resultados productivos e incluso abandono de las actividades por los productores. Los montes ya no cumplen sus funciones en el atemperamiento del impacto de las lluvias sobre el suelo, incrementando los caudales excesivos de agua que generan erosión hídrica de los mantos orgánicos superficiales, que afecta la posibilidad de que los montes se reestablezcan de forma natural. Desde el año 2012, el Grupo Agroforestal de INTA Reconquista inició experiencias de manejo sustentable de bosque nativo mediante la implementación de sistemas silvopastoriles (una combinación de manejo ganadero y forestal) de manera participativa con productores del Norte de Santa Fe (Ocampo, s.f.).  También la situación actual de  uso agrícola de la tierra erosionó en el corto plazo en las propiedades químicas de los suelos que sustentan su productividad, como el contenido de carbono orgánico, nitrógeno total, se acidificó el suelo y  en se disminuyó el contenido de las formas extractables de nutrientes esenciales como fósforo, como también  la profundidad del horizonte superficial de suelo (Heredia, 2006).Esto es consecuencia de modelos productivos que agotaron el recurso en el pasado, en forma general en todas las fincas, que conjugaron prácticas como el monocultivo, el laboreo frecuente y baja reposición de compuestos orgánicos. Actualmente se utilizan modelos conservacionistas como la siembra directa que permiten mantener e incrementar la productividad, pero que demandan insumos para complementar las necesidades de cultivos. Estos incrementan los costos de producción y generan la necesidad acceso a financiamiento productivo, con lo cual gran parte de los productores están volviendo a utilizar formas de producción degradante del suelo, para disminuir sus costos y mantenerse en el sistema.

Parts of the coast are protected by defences. Climate change is projected to result in winters that are up to 33% wetter by 2070 with a higher frequency of storms as well as potential sea level rise of 1.13m by 2100, with many more metres potentially ""locked in"".  This poses a major risk in the district, particularly to Minehead, Watchet, Blue Anchor, Porlock, Hinkley Point and Stolford. The combination of drier summers, sea level rise and increased frequency of storms will drive coastal erosion too. Further to this, sea level rise poses a risk to the ""locking"" of the River Tone which in turn would lead to increase fluvial flooding upstream."

By 2070, climate change is projected to result in winters that are up to 33% wetter with a higher frequency of storms, and summers are expected to be up to 57% drier. This increases the likelihood and potential magnitude of such flooding events. In addition to this, combinations of high tides and high river levels in the River Parrett can lead to a “locking” of the River Tone, which can increase the likelihood of flooding upstream. Rising sea levels and increased rainfall is likely to exacerbate and increase the likelihood of this occurring from “locking” events and breach of sea defences. The SFRA Level 1 assesses risks in the district (excluding Exmoor National Park) and considers projections from the UKCP18 projections. The Taunton Strategic Flood Alleviation Improvements Scheme has been produced and identifies priority projects to mitigate flood risk in Taunton.

There has been significant damages to homes and commercial properties due to flooding,  risk of transportation on roads, aging infrastructure, animal habitat, etc. In 2017, a major road in Whitby's downtown was closed due to flooding of the area (Brock Street South/Waste Street) and residents were urged to stay aware from bluffs and urged to use caution near the waterfront. In the Durham Community Climate Adaptation Plan. it has been projected that the occurrence of flooding will only increase in local municipalities of Durham, including Whitby, therefore new climate resilience standards must be included. Just this year in 2019. Central Lake Ontario Conservation Authority (CLOCA) issues a flood warning for the Lake Ontario shoreline in the Town of Whitby. It was expected that the storm brought 15-35mm of rain. In the future, there is high risk for stormwater facilities, roads and transportation, sanitary services, erosion, pollution, electrical services, communications services, social services, EMS, police, public use of flood plains, damage to private assets, social disruption, and business disruption.

This has serious consequences for elderly, children, and vulnerable populations who would be severely impacted by heat waves. Back in 2016, drought conditions were parching the countryside in Durham and transforming the green landscape to dry land. This impacted people across all demographics, and resulted in Town events (e.g. Ribfest) being almost unbearably hot. This impacts crops and gives high cost to local farmers who are trying to sustain their own business and local communities. The drought conditions placed high stress on any newly planted trees, as they lacked the sufficient water supply to establish solid growth. In the future, the extreme heat will continue to impact outside workers, reduce asset life, accelerate challenges of ageing infrastructure, vegetation management and growing seasons, transmission and  disruption outages, social disruption, health related death and illness, buckling of pavement and bridges, softening of asphalt, and impacts to water supply in the Town of Whitby.

Back in 2018, severe windstorms were felt in Whitby. This caused loose objects to be overturned, older buildings to be more susceptible to damage, branches and top heavy trees to snap, impacted streelights and powerlines. In May of 2019, with CLOCA issuing the flood warning there were heavy concerns relating to the wind forecast which saw winds from 30-40km/h and gusts up to 80km/h. With high water levels and significant winds there were impacts to low-lying and flood prone areas due to storm surge and wave uprush. Within the Durham Community Climate Adaptation plan of 2016, it is expected that by 2040-2049, more extreme weather events with high winds and heavy rain will impact municipalities in Durham region. This will continue to cause power outages and infrastructure damages. In the future,  extreme winds will bring power outages caused by infrastructure damages, infectious borne diseases, road failure through subsoil failure, pavement structure failure,  and increases of chronic and acute exposure for public health air quality.

There would be increased impacts on aging infrastructure and road capacity within the Town of Whitby. Back in 2018, Whitby and several other Durham Municipalities were dealing with extreme winter conditions. This ranged from freezing rain to heavy snowfall that occured overnight. In 2018, Environment Canada issued a rainfall warning with rainfall amounts in the 20mm to 30mm range. The ice accumulations, combined with gusty winds (from 40km/h to 70km/h) had strong potential to result in power outages due to fallen trees and power lines, with the continued threat of flooding. These types of storms will continue  to occur, even more frequently, and result in greater damages to both private and public property. In the future, under the Durham Community Climate Adaptation Plan, it is expected that there will be a medium risk for infrastructure failure leading to power outages (due to ice accretion and trees falling on lines), increase in invasive species (increase in local pests), and more fluctuation of winter climates resulting in more rain during the winter months (leading to increase threat of flooding).

The runoff will then take place on the surface. The conduit networks are normally designed for rain with a return time of 2-10 years. New systems that are being built are dimensioned with a climate factor and higher capacity, but the existing network will limit capacity. They can also be dimensioned for a smaller area, and later connected to new networks making the network larger than originally intended.Possible consequences for downpours include limited accessibility, interruptions in power supply due to flooding (with consequential effects), overloading of wastewater and sewage treatment plants, water damage in buildings and erosion.

The number of occasions where the conditions for avalanches may occur may increase due to milder and wetter winters. It is likely that groundwater levels and groundwater flows will increase in a wetter climate, which can cause increased groundwater erosion. A higher intensity and volume in the downpour also means an increased risk of landslade along superficial flow paths, undermining of land (including road banks and embankments) and for landslides due to rapidly rising and falling water levels in streams and smaller watercourses.

In the period 2015 - 2018, 1022 “storm water flooding and 1.561 “clogged drain” malfunction calls were made. Floods and sudden stormwaters that may occur due to excessive climate events, impacts on water and wastewater systems and sectoral water supply problems require public authorities to implement adaptation measures. Although Büyük Menderes River is cut by channels, dams and dykes, it causes floods at villages such as A. Mahmutlar during severe precipitation, and thousands of decares of land are flooded. DSI tries to protect the villages within Büyük Menderes Basin through reclamation operations. Dalaman Brook causes floods which affect the settlements of Denizli. Although under control by channels and dykes, flood occurs under very severe precipitation. The greatest impact of Dalaman Brook and its branches is the erosions that they cause at the area of Çameli.34% of the total damage (119,5 million TRY) as a result of hail - flood and drought incidences affecting the agricultural areas in Denizli Province occurred in the year 2018.  When the damages in that year are examined as per the affected products, the damages on vineyard products form about 31% of all the damage.Expected risk levels on agriculture and ecosystem sector are as follows:- Submerging of fertile agricultural lands as a result of floods is very high between 2015-2044.- Decrease in the production of agricultural products at processing  factories as a  result of decrease in agricultural production due to extreme precipitation, storm and flood incidences is very high between 2015-2044.Expected risk levels on water and waste water service sector are as follows:- Damage at urban spaces as a result of floods at urban areas due to sudden and extreme precipitation is high between 2015-2044.- Damage at historical artworks at antique areas due to increasing floods is high between 2045-2074.Expected risk levels on industry sector are as follows:- Damages on factories, and on other fixed assets due to floods is medium between 2015-2044.- Occurrence of electricity interruptions as a result of damage on energy infrastructure due to floods is very high between 2015-2044.

According to the average temperature of many years, a difference of 1,5°C is observed in the average temperature in the period 2017-2018. As this state is varying as per the type of plant, it brings forward the phenology by 20 days for the year 2018. For this reason, it has been determined that the risk of fruit trees to be affected from the early frosts of spring due to early blooming of them is high.   When the data of the recent four years in the Denizli Province are examined, the risk of occurrence of late frosts of spring between April 20 and 25 is very high.All the damages in the year 2007 arose from drought, nearly all of them in the year 2009 arose from hail, nearly all of them in the year 2010 arose from excessive precipitation and hail, all of them in the year 2011 arose from excessive precipitation and hail, 80% of them in the year 2012 from frost and 20% of them in the year 2012 from hail - storm, 74% of them in the year 2013 from hail and 26% of them in the year 2013 from storm and frost, 74% of them in the year 2014 from drought and 14% of them in the year 2014 from hail - flood, 73% of them in the year 2015 from frost and cold and 19% of them in the year 2015 from hail - flood, 77% of them in the year 2016 from drought and 14% of them in the year 2016 from frost, 95% of them in the year 2017 from hail - flood, hail and hail - storm, and finally 93% of them in the year 2018 from hail - flood and hail - flood - storm.

A baixa latitude condiciona à cidade temperaturas elevadas, números também elevado de horas de sol por ano e índices acentuados de evapotranspiração, devido à incidência praticamente perpendicular dos raios solares sobre a superfície do solo.  E em termos geológicos, é constituída por embasamento cristalino onde a água é armazenada em fendas/fraturas na rocha (aquífero fissural) e com baixa capacidade volumétrica.Sabe-se que pelo menos 13% do semiárido brasileiro enfrenta o processo de desertificação. Segundo a Secretaria de Meio Ambiente e Sustentabilidade do Estado de Pernambuco (SEMAS-PE), 80% do teritório pernambucano está localizada na parte semiárida do país. E dos 184 municípios, 122 estão em áreas suscetíveis à desertificação devido às alterações climáticas e Serra Talhada está entre estas cidades. Os agricultores, cujo trabalho depende diretamente da chuva,  sempre sofreram com estas questões do clima, uma vez que as chuvas são concentradas em poucos dias do ano. A agropecuária está como as principais causas de desertificação.

As enchentes e inundações nessas duas áreas são causados pelas fortes chuvas causando a cheia dos rios Póxim e Paramopama. Dessa forma as águas elevam-se acima do normal. Consequentemente as águas acabam invadindo o espaço de moradia dessa população, além de ruas e empreendimentos comerciais. Sobremaneira são problemas causados por ações humanas e também por fatores naturais. Não podemos desprezar a poluição excessiva, que entope bueiros e galerias que são construídas para reter e impedir o acúmulo de água das chuvas nas ruas e os desmatamentos dos mangues que tem a função de segurar as águas que expande ou reduzir o seu fluxo.Para o futuro .Para o futuro, caso não tenhamos nenhuma ação concreta que contenha essa devastação natural, teremos consequentemente acréscimo das necessidades do serviço público, no tocante a saúde, infraestrutura, assistência social, serviços urbanos.

Urban sprawl can drive demand for clean water higher, causing security concerns. As stated in Laos PDR's National Strategy on Climate Change, ""water availability is projected to decrease by 10–30% over mid-latitudes and in the dry tropics. Drought-affected areas will likely increase in extent. At the same time, heavy precipitation incidents, also expected to increase in frequency, will augment flood risk."" Further, temperature changes in the Lower Mekong Basin region will vary compared to baseline conditions within a range of 1 ºC ~ 2ºC, causing longer summer periods.Impacts of drought can also have broad consequences to biodiversity and natural resources for livelihood, such as the availability of fish stock and aquatic resources, which support 90% of local diets at a national level (Lao PDR National Climate Change Strategy)."

La cuenca de este río se caracteriza por una hidrología muy irregular, registra en cortos periodos de tiempo incrementos significativos de caudales de río, tributarios y quebradas. A esto se suma los efectos del Fenómeno El Niño (FEN) que, aunque se presenta en forma esporádica, genera inundaciones recurrentes que afectan a la población, la capacidad productiva, la infraestructura y los servicios públicos y privados.  Todo ello, eleva el grado de exposición al riesgo de la población y el territorio, lo que aumenta las situaciones de vulnerabilidad frente a los desastres ocasionados por fenómenos naturales. Recientemente, en marzo del 2017 se sufrió el evento denominado Fenómeno del Niño Costero, con un lluvia intensa que afectaron viviendas y vías principales de la ciudad.

Due to the fact that the city is located by the sea and is a windy city, it may encounter natural disasters due to precipitation, although not very often. After the flood disaster that occurred in 2017 and caused 200 million Turkish liras of damage, the flood disaster that hit the whole of the city on January 6-7, 2020 again was affected by 8 thousand 386 greenhouses, 951 gardens, 30 thousand 421 decares of field flood waters. Therefore, these damages should be evaluated as the reflections of the Climate Crisis.

With an increasing frequency and intensity in precipitation expected as a result of climate change, we can expect flooding, in particular surface water flooding, to occur more frequently. Wandsworth has experienced a number of surface water flood events, the most notable of which was on the 20th July 2007 where intense periods of rainfall caused flash floods and the capacity of the existing drainage system to be exceeded in several locations across the Borough. This caused overland flow and ponding in low-lying areas and impacted residents, businesses and the transport network across the Borough. Tooting Bec and Tooting Broadway railway stations had to be closed due to flooding. Schools, public buildings, residential properties, the transport network and council vehicles all suffered damage. The total cost of repairs to the council amounted to over £400,000. A similar event was seen in July 2009, when Southside Shopping Centre in Wandsworth and South Thames College were evacuated, with significant disruptions to transport and other damage caused, as a result of torrential downpours. We can also expect to see more flooding from ground water and sewage.

However, storms and wind do currently lead to outages of services, and if extreme wind were to increase in frequency then service outages could become more frequent. For example, falling trees and other debris can cause significant disruption to travel and electricity supply, and potentially all services can be affected depending on the nature of the specific incident.  Railways can also be affected by damage to overhead lines. There is also a risk to life and property with falling trees and debris.  As a local authority we are responsible for the integrity of street trees and trees within our parks and open spaces. If extreme winds were to become more common or more intense, this will mean an additional burden on local authorities to ensure trees are healthy and well placed to withstand extreme wind. Even with additional safeguards, extreme winds can cause otherwise healthy trees to fall with a risk to life and property.

In the UK around 2,000 people died prematurely and deaths among people aged over 75 rose by 60 per cent in London. Whilst this heatwave was particularly notable for the link to increased mortality, there have been a number of heatwaves since, increasing in frequency. The most recent heatwave was during the summer of 2020 when temperatures in part of London reached 36.4 Celsius and multiple 'tropical nights'. Heatwaves do not only lead to an increase in mortality and impact on health, they can also affect food supply, water supply, biodiversity and transport and are associated with public disorder. Buckling of road surfaces and train tracks may occur in spells of hot weather during summer months.

For this reason, an extreme cold wave is not expected to be a significant hazard for the future. Nonetheless, even with a warmer climate overall, there remains some risk of an extreme cold wave. An estimated 10.1% of households in Wandsworth live in fuel poverty (LGA, 2018) and the Council supports local residents through a fuel crisis assistance scheme and through a Winter Warm Service.

At this point along its course, the water levels in the River Thames are tidally influenced. Flood Zone mapping identifies that a large area covering Battersea and Clapham Junction and smaller areas to the north of Wandsworth and Putney are in Flood Zone 3 associated with the River Thames, which is defined as land that would be expected to flood during a flood event with a 0.5% AEP, when excluding the presence of defences. However, these areas do benefit from The ThamesTidal Defence (TTD) system including both the raised flood defence walls along the River Thames frontage, as well as the Thames Barrier located downstream at Woolwich. The risk of tidal flooding to these northern parts of Wandsworth is therefore a residual risk at present, in the event of a breach or overtopping of the local flood defences.  This risk will increase in the future as a result of climate change and is modelled in greater detail in our flood risk assessment. Modelling within this assessment also identifies that climate change is likely to result in a significant increase in the flood extent associated with the River Wandle through Southfields andKing George’s Park and a slight increase in the flood extent associated with the River Graveney in Tooting Graveney.

This is also linked to severe weather events, high temperatures can alter pathogen survival, replication and virulence, heavy rainfall events can mobilise pathogens and compromise water and sanitation infrastructure, and drought can concentrate pathogens in limited water supplies.

Most mosquito species native to the UK do not transmit diseases (some Culex mosquitoes are capable of transmitting West Nile Virus. However, invasive mosquitoes such as Aedes albopictus, are capable of transmitting dengue and chikungunya diseases and Adese albopictus was recorded in southern England in 2016, 2017 and 2018, despite  originating in southeast Asia. Recently, there have been changes in vector distribution across the UK. This includes identification of invasive species, such as Aedes albopictus, in Southern England as well as changing patterns of tick distributions. The causes of these changes are complex, however, climate change is thought to be a main contributory factor. Climate change causing higher temperatures, speed up mosquito development allowing for potentially earlier infection. Whilst temperature has less of an effect on ticks than it does on mosquitoes, ticks are affected by other climate variables such as mositure levels. Ticks are a key vector for the Borrelia bacteria that causes Lyme disease and can act as a vector for act as a vector for tick-borne encephalitis (TBE). TBE, however, is not present in the UK although it has been recorded in several European countries including Switzerland and the Netherlands.  Ticks that may carry Lyme disease are common, found especially in woodlands and parks with deer, such as Richmond Park which is on the border with Wandsworth and will be visited by many Wandsworth residents. This is therefore already having a slight impact on Wandsworth residents, but may increase as a result of climate change. The identification of invasive mosquito species in Southern England can be expected to affect Wandsworth as a borough in this region.

A crise hídrica vem se agravando a cada ano em virtude do uso não controlado dos recursos naturais. Tanto pela concessionária responsável pela captação e abastecimento hídrico, quanto  pelos pequenos produtores que também captam água da mesma bacia. A compactação do solo, o aumento expressivo do escoamento superficial das águas pluviais, a ocupação de planícies fluviais, além dos fenômenos climáticos, como o período de chuva reduzida, em conjunto do uso indiscriminado principalmente pela agricultura, impactarão em verdadeiras crises hídricas em tempo de estiagem. Futuramente, curto, médio e em longo prazo, a concessionária apresentou ao Município ação de mitigação e adaptação em relação à captação e distribuição da água e esgoto.O ano 2019 foi o ano com menor quantidade de chuvas já registrado na cidade de Goiás. O município de Goiás,possui registros pluviométricos desde o ano de 1961. Nestes 58 anos de coleta de dados, o ano de 2019 apresentou a menor pluviometria (quantidade de chuvas), anual já registrados . Foram apenas 933,2 milímetros de precipitação totalizada no ano. Até então, o pior desempenho havia ocorrido em 2015 e 2002, com 1172,5 mm e 1209,8 mm respectivamente.

A possibilidade de novas enchentes faz com que a comunidade ribeirinha ao Rio Vermelho, fiquem sempre atentos em épocas de chuvas, considerando os significativos danos causados ao município ao longo de sua existência, pela repetição de eventos de mesma natureza. Os estragos das inundações são vinculados não só pela fragilidade da área atingida, em função do tipo de ocupação e uso do solo, da área da bacia e da infra-estrutura de saneamento básico, como também, dos danos ambientais no curso do Rio Vermelho, desde sua nascente, a montante da cidade, até a ocupação de sua planície de inundação.O acervo arquitetônico é reconhecido mundialmente, tanto que em 2001, a Organização das Nações Unidades, através da UNESCO, tornou-se a Cidade de Goiás patrimônio da humanidade, deixando de ser simplesmente uma cidade histórica brasileira.

El comportamiento en los últimos años ha variado considerablemente de acuerdo al cambio climático que azota el mundo entero.Al enfocarnos en el último lustro observamos que la temporada lluviosa se ha hecho cada vez más corta, provocando que todas nuestras afluentes hídricas se vean impactadas en cuanto a volumen y fluidez del agua. En la temporada seca son significativos los daños a los cultivos de nuestros productores quienes son los principales actores de la economía regional. En este punto el Gobierno Nacional crea el ‘’Plan Sequía’’ proyecto dirigido a apoyar a los productores que han enfrentado grandes pérdidas a través de financiamiento, suministro de nuevos productos como semillas, entre otros. En el sector ganadero el impacto ha sido muy alto, provocando hasta la muerte de las ganado bovino, el aumento de gastos económicos porque ante la escases de alimentación tradicional como lo es el pasto (hierba)se tiene que comprar alimento comercial, siendo inevitable el común mal de las “vacas flacas”. Disminuyen los precios del producto obligando la venta del mismo y el abuso del comercio. También es considerado este problema dentro del plan sequía.La población ocueña se ve afectada tanto en el área urbana y rural quienes empiezan a carecer del suministro de agua potable. En la parte urbana debido al aumento poblacional y fuertes sequías de la temporada seca se queda sin el suministro incluso durante incluso durante el días y en el área rural quienes se abastecen directamente de ríos y quebradas presentan el mismo problema. Actualmente se da inicio a los trabajos del alcantarillado del pueblo (centro urbano) y sustitución de todas las tuberías de asbestos.El municipio de Ocú dentro de las acciones a futuro del Departamento de Gestión Ambiental, Reducción de Riesgos y Cambio Climático en conjunto con ente pertinentes pretende realizar un estudio de la sequía en Ocú y sus impactos para aplicar nuevas estrategias que busquen el reforzamiento del “Plan Sequía” en esta región buscando siempre el beneficio de toda la población.

En otras áreas forestales los incendios se dan con intervalos de hasta décadas, pero en la reserva en mención presentan incendios por lo menos una vez cada año.Las causas de los incendios forestales inciden en la fusión de las altas temperaturas típicas de la temporada seca, sequias y el factor detonante: las malas prácticas agrícolas. Los productores agrícolas regionales aplican prácticas tradicionales equivocas como la quema, método utilizado para la limpieza de las parcelas en fincas. En estas fincas que colindan con los limites de las reservas forestales provocan un irreparable daño a los pulmones verdes de toda la región. Las autoridades que han politizado su acción en el poder, no han aplicado las sanciones correspondientes que ampara la ley, se ha evitado la concientización ambiental en los agricultores. Las autoridades actuales del municipio de Ocú han estado en constantes reuniones con los colindantes de las reservas para llegar a acuerdos que logren mitigar los daños causados y busquen evitar futuros incendios, además de la aplicación rigurosa de sanciones a los productores que se les compruebe ser los causales de los incendios forestales. Complementando esta mancuerna de estrategias con la reforestación de arboles forestales en las zonas afectadas por los anteriores incendios.

Afectando en temas de agricultura, construcciones, suministro eléctrico, transporte, educación, entre otros.Al abarcar el sector agropecuario se analiza el deslave masivo de siembras en rubros comunes en nuestra región, como son: yuca, maíz, arroz, otoe, ñame… debido al impacto generado por el viento ante la baja resistencia de la estructura física de estos rubros.En las construcciones es inevitable pensar en las consecuencias que un vendaval o un fuerte viento provocan. Los daños que producen los fuertes vientos son una preocupación bastante común en ciertas áreas de nuestra región, ya que es de conocimiento general que el viento juega un papel turbulento en cada época lluviosa. Las afectaciones más comunes en estos casos y en el suministro eléctrico son el desprendimiento de estructuras como antenas, cables, postes y desprendimiento de techos. Cabe resaltar que la caída de árboles a causa de los fuertes vientos provoca afectaciones en las infraestructuras que a simple vista no pueden ser evaluados, ya que la fatiga sufrida en la construcción por el impacto se verá en la disminución de su resistencia. En el caso del suministro eléctrico se ve afectado por muchas variantes que pueden causar daños que suspenden el suministro por lapsos de tiempos indefinidos, como lo son los postes derrumbados, los tendidos eléctricos afectados por las caídas de árboles, entre otras afectaciones.Moviéndonos al tema de las afectaciones en el ámbito del transporte, nos vemos fuertemente ligados a que nuestras vías de transporte terrestre en muchas regiones están fuertemente rodeadas de árboles, los cuales en este punto representan un peligro por tema de los fuertes vientos que los azotan en cierta época ocasionando obstrucción en nuestras carreteras que desenvuelve un retraso a lo largo del camino quedando inaccesible estas áreas hasta que se sufraguen las afectaciones en la vía.En la educación, vemos reflejada una gran afectación a causa de una mezcla de los puntos anteriormente mencionados, teniendo una ausencia de suministro eléctrico, transporte y fuertes causas que afectan directamente a la educación de miles de estudiante a lo largo del distrito.

Se analizan las precipitaciones para el periodo de 1996-2017, determinándose la probabilidad de excedencia y periodo de retorno. Los principales variables que influyeron en el desarrollo de remociones en masa correspondieron a fuertes pendiente, geomorfología asociadas a terraza de erosión de la cordillera de Nahuelbuta y coberturas de suelo urbano. la probabilidad de excedencia indicó que, a partir de un periodo de retorno de 2 años, las precipitaciones podrían exceder los 68,1 mm en 24 horas, monto suficiente para desencadenar procesos de remoción en masa. Con este escenario, el aumento en las precipitaciones, el probable  aumento de urbanizaciones irregulares en zonas de pendientes de la cordillera de Nahuelbuta, se espera que la remoción en masa impacte a un mayor numero de personas, de lo que actualmente impacta.

The borough is very susceptible to surface water flooding, seen most dramatically in the summer of 2007. Richmond, in conjunction with the Environment Agency, has identified a series of localised flooding issues, partly through consultation with the community when producing the Borough’s Preliminary Flood Risk Assessment (2011), Local Flood Risk Management Strategy (2015) and Surface Water Management Plan (2011). The majority of the localised flooding incidents were typically as a result of blocked gullies and/or culverts, sewer flooding or surface waterflooding. The latter is known to be a concern within the Borough, as the topography results in some steep slopes, especially in Richmond town centre which can form flow paths for surface water runoff and subsequently pluvial flooding at lower elevations. During heavy rains, runoff can flow very quickly along these paths and the local drainage system is unable to cope.Our Strategic Flooding Risk Assessment lays out the impact of flooding in the borough, both in the past and expected in further detail: https://www.richmond.gov.uk/media/14421/richmond_sfra_0516.pdf

However, storms and wind do currently lead to outages of services, and if extreme wind were to increase in frequency then service outages could become more frequent. For example, falling trees and other debris can cause significant disruption to travel and electricity supply, and potentially all services can be affected depending on the nature of the specific incident.  Railways can also be affected by damage to overhead lines. There is also a risk to life and property with falling trees and debris.  As a local authority we are responsible for the integrity of street trees and trees within our parks and open spaces. Richmond is a borough with a significant proportion of open spaces (although not all is managed by the local authority). If extreme winds were to become more common or more intense, this will mean an additional burden on local authorities to ensure trees are healthy and well placed to withstand extreme wind. Even with additional safeguards, extreme winds can cause otherwise healthy trees to fall with a risk to life and property.

In the UK around 2,000 people died prematurely and deaths among people aged over 75 rose by 60 per cent in London. Whilst this heatwave was particularly notable for the link to increased mortality, there have been a number of heatwaves since, increasing in frequency. The most recent heatwave was during the summer of 2020 when temperatures in Richmond Borough reached 36.4 Celsius and multiple 'tropical nights'. Heatwaves do not only lead to an increase in mortality and impact on health, they can also affect food supply, water supply, biodiversity and transport and are associated with public disorder. Buckling of road surfaces and train tracks may occur in spells of hot weather during summer months.

The majority of the localised flooding incidents were typically as a result of blocked gullies and/or culverts, sewer flooding or surface waterflooding. The latter is known to be a concern within the Borough, as the topography results in some steep slopes, especially in Richmond town centre which can form flow paths for surface water runoff and subsequently pluvial flooding at lower elevations. During heavy rains, runoff can flow very quickly along these paths and the local drainage system is unable to cope.Our Strategic Flooding Risk Assessment lays out the impact of flooding in the borough, both in the past and expected in further detail: https://www.richmond.gov.uk/media/14421/richmond_sfra_0516.pdf

Therefore, a relatively large number of properties within the Borough are potentially at risk of floodingfrom rivers. The River Thames within this Borough extends from Barnes to Hampton Court (upstream of Teddington Weir). Teddington Weir represents the upper tidal extent of the RiverThames, and the Borough is at risk from both fluvial (river) and tidal (sea) flooding. Downstream of Teddington Weir, the Borough is protected against flooding from the River Thames by the Thames Tidal Defence (TTD) system. The TTD system provides protection against tidal flooding through a combination of raised flood defences, flood proofing to riverside properties and the Thames Barrier. Within the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames, the current understanding of the flooding regime appears to indicate that the increase in the number of properties potentially at risk of flooding in 2010 as a result of climate change is relatively small. Rather, those properties that are currently at risk can expect to be affected by flooding more frequently and to a greater severity. It is therefore important that the Borough has a clear policy in place to deal with the potential impacts of climate change, both for those properties that are currently affected by flooding andwhere the severity may increase in the future, and for those that are currently not at risk but may be at risk in future years.

This is also linked to severe weather events, high temperatures can alter pathogen survival, replication and virulence, heavy rainfall events can mobilise pathogens and compromise water and sanitation infrastructure, and drought can concentrate pathogens in limited water supplies.

Most mosquito species native to the UK do not transmit diseases (some Culex mosquitoes are capable of transmitting West Nile Virus. However, invasive mosquitoes such as Aedes albopictus, are capable of transmitting dengue and chikungunya diseases and Adese albopictus was recorded in southern England in 2016, 2017 and 2018, despite  originating in southeast Asia. Recently, there have been changes in vector distribution across the UK. This includes identification of invasive species, such as Aedes albopictus, in Southern England as well as changing patterns of tick distributions. The causes of these changes are complex, however, climate change is thought to be a main contributory factor. Climate change causing higher temperatures, speed up mosquito development allowing for potentially earlier infection. Whilst temperature has less of an effect on ticks than it does on mosquitoes, ticks are affected by other climate variables such as mositure levels. Ticks are a key vector for the Borrelia bacteria that causes Lyme disease and can act as a vector for act as a vector for tick-borne encephalitis (TBE). TBE, however, is not present in the UK although it has been recorded in several European countries including Switzerland and the Netherlands.  Ticks that may carry Lyme disease are common, found especially in woodlands and parks with deer, such as Richmond Park and Bushy Park, both within Richmond Borough. This is therefore already having a slight impact on Richmond residents, but may increase as a result of climate change. The identification of invasive mosquito species in Southern England can be expected to affect Wandsworth as a borough in this region.

Esto generó un desabastecimiento de agua en el cantón, lo que propició cortes en el suministro por hasta 8 horas en el sector central. Por otra parte, algunas comunidades rurales, perforaban pozos ilegales a una distancia muy próxima, lo que secó mantos acuíferos y nuevamente propició el consumo de arsénico en el agua. En el sector agropecuario, existió escasez de agua en los canales de riego y ocasionó inconvenientes en la planta de producción de energía hidroeléctrica por el bajo caudal de agua en los ríos. Muchos centros educativos cerraron por la falta de agua, mientras se compraban tanques reservorios para abastecerlos y resolver paliativamente la falta de recurso y prevenir la proliferación de enfermedades como la diarrea. Asimismo, la presencia de arsénico provocó que muchas personas desarrollaran Enfermedad Renal Crónica, por lo que una buena parte de la población (sumado a los trabajos que realizaban como peones de finca) esté siendo controlada médicamente por problemas renales. La escasez de agua también ha limitado el desarrollo urbanístico y comercial, ya que no se están emitiendo certificados de disponibilidad de agua (requisito para poder construir), lo cual repercute en que las personas no inviertan en construcción, personas que dependen de esta actividad estén desempleadas y que muchas familias no puedan acceder al bono de vivienda, ya que la red de agua potable sostiene la cantidad de usuarios activa que actualmente tiene. De no resolverse esta situación, es posible que el desarrollo urbanístico y comercial siga retenido, que continúen las suspensiones programadas de agua potable y que tanto la agricultura como la generación de energía hidroeléctrica se vean comprometidas.

Due to a changing climate, the Western Adelaide Region is already experiencing longer, hotter and more frequent heatwaves which have the potential to impact the health and well-being of our community, as well as the councils’ ability to deliver key services. The future urban form will also have higher densities, smaller backyards and less opportunity for trees or other green infrastructure to assist with cooling. Results have been used to inform key priorities for the work we do, such as urban greening and prioritising tree planting, water sensitive urban design and urban design projects. Heatwaves and higher temperatures experienced in summer impact community health, which often results in increased mortality, hospital admissions and ambulance call-outs.  In particular, higher temperatures impact members of the community who have pre-existing conditions relating to heart, renal and mental health.

Regional vulnerabilities to drought stem from a combination of moderate precipitation amounts and relatively short growing season (compared to other parts of the state), relatively high evaporation rates, deep soils, poor groundwater, reliance on surface water and historical occurrences (including current drought conditions). Drought will continue to impact the Kansas City region, most notably in the agricultural sector and areas of the region with high drought susceptibility. Due to the region’s general abundance of potable water via the Kansas and Missouri Rivers and alluvial wells, short-term droughts are not likely to have direct, lasting impacts on the entire region, but may have meaningful impacts on individual communities.

This probability includes any type of severe winter weather. According to the National Climate Assessment (2018), winters are already trending warmer. The warmer and shorter winters may allow for a longer growing season; however, they may also promote the growth of weeds and pests, and shorten the dormancy for many winter crops, which could increase crop losses during spring freezes. Pests, like the emerald ash borer, could cause greater harm to the urban tree canopy. Precipitation may also change with winter warming, where precipitation falls as rain and not snow.

Historically, fourteen of these mega rain events have been recorded since 1866, with half of these events occurring within the last fourteen years.These extreme rainfall trends put a strain on stormwater infrastructure and other surface water conveyance or retention efforts. Given the fact that much of the stormwater infrastructure within the Twin Cities metro was designed to convey surface water based on technical standards and rainfall estimations adopted in 1960, the increasingly short, intense rainfalls present a challenge forcommunities and for the Metropolitan Council.The National Climate Assessment states that the Midwest has already experienced a 37% increase in these larger rain events of 2.5 inches or greater (US Global Change Research Program, 2014). The extreme rainfall changes in the Midwest are only second to those of the Northeast US between 1958 and 2012. From an asset management perspective, the financial implications of inaction are well researched and documented. According to the US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), federal insurance claims for flooding damage averaged $1.9 billion a year annually between 2006 and 2015, making flooding the costliest and most common type of natural disaster in the US (Planning Magazine, 2017).The State Climatologists tell us that we will see a marked increase in the frequency and magnitude of extreme precipitation in the coming year, which will cause localized flooding in our region.Our assessment focuses on the climate hazard of localized flooding for several reasons, including:1) Increases in extreme rainfall have already occurred, and this trend shows the highest probabilityof continuing in the future.2) Council assets are susceptible to vulnerabilities from potential localized flooding, includingdisruptions to the transit system, increase in inflow/infiltration to our wastewater infrastructure,adverse effects to water supply and water quality, and health and safety concerns for the region,for our customers, and for our employees.

Research has shown that higher temperatures are amplified in areas with higher concentrations of pavement and impervious surface, as these areas tend to absorb residual heat and hold that heat longer than vegetation would. This effect is called the Urban Heat Island effect, or UHI. Buildings can block the wind, reducing a mitigating effect on the extreme heat. The four components that make up the UHI are lack of vegetation, a high percentage of impervious surfaces, residual heat from cars and mechanical cooling, and building shape and size.Why Focus on Extreme HeatOur assessment focuses on extreme heat for several reasons, including:1. Though heat waves have not shown an upward trend, heat waves are more likely to occur in the future, beyond the year 2025, according the Minnesota State Climatology Office. 2. Human vulnerability to extreme heat is of concern for many stakeholders in the region, particularly county public health departments and agency partners.3. The data created for the assessment allows us to investigate the relationship between the overall built and natural environment and the UHI effect.Until now, no screening tool with regional coverage has been created to identify extreme heat through UHI. Our tool may provide leverage in advancing analysis and more resources to help reduce the effects of extreme heat through proactive planning and on-the-ground implementation.

De acuerdo al Atlas de Riesgos de Uruapan, 2019, las precipitaciones máximas probables acorde a los registros de las 4 estaciones meteorológicas  que se involucran en el municipio de Uruapan,  los resultados a 2 años van de 66 mm a 85 mm diarios;  a 10 años, entre 105 mm a  207 mm diarios; y a 50 años, desde 140 mm hasta los 320 años, de acuerdo a los cálculos estimados.
