In the ""energy"" category participants agreed on a goal that by 2036, 30 per cent of Calgary’s energy derives from low-impact renewable sources.The provincial government has made public statements around renewable energy targets for the Alberta grid. The Government of Alberta website says:""To increase the use of renewables to generate electricity and reduce emissions in Alberta, the government launched the Renewable Electricity Program. This program will add 5,000 megawatts of renewable electricity capacity by 2030 and puts Alberta on a path to achieve a target of 30 per cent renewable energy by that time.""The Government of Alberta is auctioning the contracts to build the new renewable energy generation in Alberta.  The competition ensures the renewable energy capacity will be delivered at attractive prices for Alberta's electricity rate payers.  Three successful bids from the first round of competition were announced Dec 13, 2017.From the Government of Alberta website:( https://www.alberta.ca/renewable-electricity-program.aspx )""Round one set a record for the lowest renewable electricity pricing in Canada with a weighted average price of 3.7 cents per kilowatt-hour. By comparison, the weighted average price for Ontario’s large renewable procurement in 2016 was 8.5 cents per kilowatt-hour.The successful companies will develop 600 megawatts of renewable electricity, enough to power 255,000 homes. This is 200 megawatts more than planned due to better-than-expected bid prices from developers. Projects will be operational by the end of 2019."""	1285711	2019	POINT (-114.071 51.0486)	2021-05-20T02:49:34.733

A major portion (more than 80%) was met with six electric generators that ran on methane gas from our landfill.  We now have converted all of the methane production at the landfill to RNG transportation fuel and inject it in an interstate pipeline and have a contract with a Wisconsin based gas-station that sells the compressed gas on Wisconsin highways.  So now we are back to 16% renewable gas.  However, we just had a 9 MW solar array approved by the PSC that will be located at our airport and we will break ground on that project this year and complete it by next year, and we just announced a 20 MW solar array that we will develop by 2023.  At that point we will be back up to 100% renewable electricity.  We already/currently have electric production at a second (closed) landfill and behind-the meter solar arrays on 16 county buildings.	542400	2018		2021-05-20T02:49:34.733

Boulder’s electricity generation mix is determined by the electric utility and therefore achieving this goal will require the following actions: (1) Reduce the need for additional generation through continued improvements in energy efficiency and productivity. Actions include: expand the energy services provided by the city and expand on-site solar installations across the community; (2) Replace all coal and natural gas electricity generation with renewable energy systems such as solar and wind. Actions include: assume operational authority and begin operations of an electric utility, and analyze local generation opportunities including combined heat and power, heating/cooling district analysis and energy storage infrastructure development; (3) Redesign the existing electricity delivery system to make it more reliable, more secure and more supportive of a diverse mix of electricity sources. Actions include: work with both institutional and private sector partners to pilot projects integrating local energy system designs with alternative electricity distribution systems, map critical community infrastructure and operations and identify opportunities to develop and deploy energy system upgrades that enable these sites to sustain operations during periods of power grid disruption, and launch the next round of community innovation investments through the Boulder Energy Challenge.

Starting in 2009, the agreement with ENMAX provided 75% of The City of Calgary's electricity from renewable sources, and 100% renewable supply started in 2014.Enmax has built wind farms (Kettle Hills and Taber) in southern Alberta where the wind resource is the best in the province in order to supply renewable energy to The City of Calgary.  Enmax registers renewable electricity certificates (RECs) with EcoLogo for the electricity generated at the wind farms on The City of Calgary's behalf.  ENMAX is also able to draw from a pool of renewable energy products (low-impact wind, hydro and biomass) generated in Alberta if the Taber and Kettle Hills wind farms do not completely cover The City's electricity consumption over a year.	1285711	2019	POINT (-114.071 51.0486)	2021-05-20T02:49:34.733

On March 22, 2019, the District's Clean Energy DC Omnibus Amendment Act of 2018 became law, which enacted the most recent update to the city's Renewable Portfolio Standard, strengthening it to require 100% of electricity come from renewable sources by 2032, including 5.5% from local solar. The law also sets a longer-term local solar generation target of meeting 10% of electricity usage with local solar by 2041.  The RPS standard was put in place in 2005 and updated in 2008, 2011, and 2016. The 2016 amendment, known as the Renewable Portfolio Standard Expansion Amendment Act of 2016 also created a funding mechanism for the Solar for All program, which establishes a goal of putting solar on 100,000 low income households in the District. In 2019, more 17.5% of total electricity use in the District was supplied by renewable energy, including 1.85 from local solar, however this is a conservative and likely underestimation, as it only captures the compliance market. There is also a voluntary renewable market, which we have not reported here as we suspect there is some overlap between the two, and we erred on the side of not double-counting that generation.	701547	2018	POINT (-77.0369 38.9072)	2021-05-20T02:49:34.733

A capital pernambucana foi selecionada para participar do ICLEI LEDS Lab, com o piloto para instalação de placas fotovoltaicas no Hospital da Mulher do Recife (HMR) apresentado  na Semana do Clima da América Latina e Caribe, em Salvador em 2019. O projeto contempla equipamentos públicos nas áreas da saúde, da educação, do esporte e no edifício-sede da Prefeitura. O orçamento total previsto do RCEE é de R$ 90 milhões sendo a instalação das placas fotovoltaicas no HMR orçada em R$ 10 milhões. Com payback previsto de 6 anos.Na saúde, o projeto contempla as Upinhas, as Unidades de Saúde da Família e o Hospital da Mulher do Recife (HMR). Esta última é a primeira unidade de saúde de grande porte construída numa gestão municipal, tendo 30 mil m2, 150 leitos e 12 especialidades médicas. Será justamente nela a primeira ação do projeto RCEE, representando o modelo de produção e consumo de energia a partir de fontes limpas e renováveis  e do enfrentamento à mudança climática.O projeto foi concebido em decorrência da projeção do aumento do consumo energético do Recife, com previsão de crescimento de até 88,4% entre os anos de 2014-2030. Como consumo de energia e emissão de gases de efeito estufa (GEE) estão diretamente relacionados, ou seja, mais consumo mais emissão. Estima-se um crescimento de 55,7% das emissões de GEE associadas a consumo energético na cidade. Segundo o último Inventário de GEE da Cidade do Recife, das emissões decorrentes do consumo de energia elétrica por parte do Governo Municipal, 23,7% são provenientes das edificações da administração pública. Diante de tais dados o projeto RCEE baseia suas diretrizes no Plano de Redução de Emissões de Gases do Efeito Estufa, desenvolvido entre 2013 e 2016 em conjunto pela PCR e pelo ICLEI.	1645727	2019	POINT (-34.8829 -8.05783)	2021-05-20T02:49:34.733

The figure is a ratio of the available local energy generation from low-carbon sources to the local domestic and non-domestic demand for energy, covering heat and electricity. It is therefore an estimate. The best estimate for March 2020, which relies upon CHP data, is a ratio of 21.5% - but it is hard to fully validate this given the data restrictions.The historical nature of this target means that there are a number of factors that make it difficult to report accurately and in context. There is some ambiguity over the original geographical scope intended and historical sources of data, in addition to changes in data availability and reporting over the years. Therefore, it is presented with the above assumptions and caveats as an indicator of progress.An initial action plan was set out in the Energy Strategy 2010 to achieve this target.	332900	2019		2021-05-20T02:49:34.733

Heka's application for Elena funding was also approved and this is is speeding up planning of renewable energy and  energy efficiency measures in renovations. Helsinki is also starting new renovation programme from beginning of 2021 to encourage private building owners to increase renewable energy and energy efficiency in renovation planning. City owned energy company Helen is also hiring private solar panels for residents, who are not able to build those on site, and is reserving large roofs for this purpose.

This portion would include no less than 20% from “tier one” renewable sources such as solar energy, wind energy, methane, geothermal, ocean, fuel cells charged from such sources, and raw or treated wastewater. Further, the carbon-free energy portion shall consist of at least 2.5% from “tier two” renewable sources such as hydroelectric power or waste-to-energy, and at least 1% from solar energy. The carbon-free energy portion would gradually increase each year, ultimately meeting the goal of 100% carbon-free energy usage in 2041. This ordinance further encourages  Metro to increase its share of ownership in community-based solar programs within Davidson County and any incentives offered by Nashville Electric Service to increase renewable energy sources when available. A strategic plan for achieving the renewable energy portfolio standard will be developed by July 1, 2020. https://www.nashville.gov/Metro-Clerk/Legislative/Ordinances/Details/d30e0174-6c6b-45d8-b93a-05b5d285c76e/2015-2019/BL2019-1600.aspxProjecting the electricity demand in MWh covered by target in 2041 is challenging since planned energy retrofits of city buildings will lower demand, while anticipated population growth  will lead to more city buildings being constructed.

Take the lead in launching the “zero carbon island” construction, launch the “Sun Island” green energy demonstration project, and fully promote the development and utilization of renewable energy. The main goal of Yangzhong Green Energy Island to zero carbon by 2020 is that the total installed capacity of distributed photovoltaic power generation will reach 400MW or more; the solar thermal households in the whole island will be covered by 100%. All the residents installed solar water heaters, the solar light thermal building integrated construction area reached more than 6 million square meters; wind power installed capacity achieved zero breakthrough, wind power installed capacity reached more than 100MW; biomass biogas utilization reached more than 12 million cubic meters; strengthen smart grid planning and Key technical research, participate in the formulation of national smart grid technical standards, build 10 new energy micro-grid demonstration projects; coal phase out. The main island eliminated all coal-fired boilers, shut down Huatai Thermal Power, and built a natural gas distributed energy station. Through the construction of the above projects, by 2020, the total consumption of clean energy will be 316,100 tons of standard coal, accounting for 33% of the total energy consumption. Yangzhong's renewable energy supply reached more than 711 million kWh, achieving 100% green electricity consumption for residents (residential electricity consumption of 293 million kWh), and 100% green electricity for service industries (service electricity consumption of 112 million kWh) .	3186300	2018		2021-05-20T02:49:34.733

Here is a link to the strategy: https://www.dorsetforyou.com/media/180518/Renewable-Energy---Bournemouth-Dorset-and-Poole-Renewable-Energy-Strategy-to-2020/pdf/Bournemouth__Dorset_and_Poole_Renewable_Energy_Strategy_to_2020.pdf  The aspirational target in the Bournemouth, Dorset and Poole Renewable Energy Strategy to 2020 is 7.5% of total energy consumption equivalent to 1,200GWh of renewable energy, from local on-shore generation by 2020. 546 GWh is equivalent to 3.4% of total energy consumption in February 2015, representing a significant increase from 0.95 % in January 2011. The Strategy covers the production of renewable electricity and renewable heat, within Dorset.   The exact amount of renewable energy which will need to be installed by 2020, to achieve national and international targets and to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, depends on actual future energy demand. If demand for energy falls, so too does the amount of heat, electricity and transport fuel which needs to be generated from renewable resources. This means that both renewable energy generation and energy efficiency measures to reduce demand, must be progressed in parallel. Within Dorset this Strategy will, therefore complement the existing Bournemouth, Dorset and Poole Energy Efficiency Strategy and Action Plan (2009) which is also being delivered by the Dorset Energy Partnership.	395300	2020	POINT (-1.88076 50.7192)	2021-05-20T02:49:34.733

It requires state electric utilities serving 25,000 or more customers to obtain at least 15 percent of their electricity from new renewable resources by 2020 and undertake all cost-effective energy conservation.For energy conservation, I-937 requires each covered utility to identify its achievable, cost-effective conservation potential over a 10-year period, starting in 2010-2011. Utilities must update those assessments at least every two years.Seattle City Light is meeting or exceeding each of these requirements. For 2010-2011, City Light's energy conservation target was 172,397 megawatt-hours. City Light achieved 267,813 megawatt-hours of energy savings, exceeding the target by 55 percent.On the new renewable energy front, City Light has contracts in place to meet I-937's escalating requirements through 2019, measured in terms of renewable energy credits. One credit is created for every megawatt-hour of new, renewable energy produced. In 2020, City Light's target rises to 1,609,000 renewable energy credits.

Currently, electricity in South Australia is generated from renewable and non-renewable sources: natural gas, wind and rooftop photovoltaics systems with some import of electricity from Victoria via the interconnector. The Low Carbon Investment Plan for South Australia has outlined an approach to achieve $10 billion of investment in low carbon energy generation by 2025. This is supported by clear policy and efficient regulatory environment, with e.g. the South Australian Government implementing the Pastoral Land Management and Conservation (Renewable Energy) Amendment Act 2015 to allow wind farms, pastoral activity and resource exploration to co-exist on Crown land used for pastoral purposes and also expedite solar developments. This plan stands alongside South Australia’s Climate Change Strategy 2015-2050, which outlines the State Government’s aspirations for a low carbon, resilient economy. The Carbon Neutral Adelaide Action Plan 2016-2021 includes a measure of success to have 15 MW of total installed capacity of solar PV in the city by 2021.

In 2015 HMGoG published its own National Renewable Energy Action Plan committing to this target. Since publishing the plan, HMGoG has successfully installed solar photovoltaic power at several sites across Gibraltar, including St Bernard’s Hospital. In addition to future planned projects, this should see Gibraltar’s solar power capacity reach 7MW by the end of 2019. Despite this, large strides will need to be made in 2020 to achieve the 20% target by the end of the year.	34838	2018	POINT (-5.35359 36.1408)	2021-05-20T02:49:34.733

Thus, reducing CO2 emissions from district heating production will be able to reduce CO2 emissions considerably.First step: From 2019, Elsinore CHP (HØK) has been transformed from natural gas cogeneration to biomass power heating. With the rebuilding, the heat production from HØK will increase, and in relation to the situation today, the rebuilt work will therefore displace natural gas heat, but also gas consumption on boilers. A large part of the CO2 potential is therefore met with this decision, and it is estimated that in 2030 production will only be needed on gas boilers in peak load situations. Second step: However, it is decided through the Plan for Climate and Sustainability 2020-2030 that Elsinore Supply Company needs to present a plan for conversion from biomass to large heat pumps and/ or similar RE alternatives.

The urban electricity grid can absorb large additional quantities of solar power so that, together with rising CHP output, Berlin has the prospect of becoming self-sufficient. By additionally expanding heat pumps and other uses of surplus renewable energy (Power-to-X, P2X), excess solar power and excess wind power from the hinterland can be utilised. A number of “smart” flexibility measures, i.e. controlled by information and communications technologies (ICT), will be implemented.

These goals have been adopted into the city’s 2035 General Plan.   Please see the 2035 General Plan and the Climate Action Plan for Internal Operations  The General Plan takes several steps to reduce carbon emissions that contribute to climate change and is the City’s action plan for greenhouse gas reductions. Mixed-use development that encourages walking and biking, use of public transit, “green building” practices, use of solar energy systems, architectural design to reduce heat gain, recycled construction materials, and water conservation measures, are some of the strategies included in the 2035 General Plan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Since 2005, the City has implemented numerous retrofit projects that have saved energy, reduced GHG emissions and energy costs. Beginning in 2009, the City has implemented numerous LED retrofit projects across the City. To date, all City-owned traffic signals, over 15,000 City-owned and maintained streetlights, 24 libraries and community centers, five parking garages, and three municipal buildings have been retrofitted with LED lighting. The City has also completed several retrofit projects replacing boilers and installing variable frequency drives (VFDs) in HVAC and pool filtration systems. In 2020, the City has developed the first Municipal Energy Benchmarking Report prioritizing City-owned buildings and facilities for additional retrofits to increase energy efficiency at municipal facilities.*Important to note: the City just began efforts to update the General Plan, including the Climate Action Plan embedded within it. These activities will take place over the next 1-2 years and will require new/updated climate/sustainability data.	513624	2019	POINT (-121.494 38.5816)	2021-05-20T02:49:34.733
